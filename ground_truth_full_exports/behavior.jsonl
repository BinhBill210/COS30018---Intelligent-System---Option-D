Two months later, I am still dealing with a first bill of over $400. It has been impossible to get an answer regarding the credits they promised. The turnover seems to be a problem too since the person who helped set up our account is no longer there. Managers do not return calls. Overall, a terrible experience with this store. I gotta say that Verizon customer service has been excellent to deal with, but still unable to resolve my issue. Not surprised to see so many one-star ratings for this store. | As far as Verizon Wireless stores go, this is better than most. That I've given it two stars isn't saying much about other Verizon stores. I've always had better luck at Circuity City. Inside, the store is very nicely laid out, brightly lit, and well organized. As well, it's well staffed.I've been to this store twice, and both were horrible experiences. The first was to buy Blackberry devices for myself and my wife, about a year and a half ago. A simple transfer took almost three hours for no apparent reason. They've got one person working the transfer desk, with a line of people waiting for their new phones, and ten employees walking around the sales floor, effectively doing nothing, since the only customers in there had already purchased phones and were waiting for them. A good manager would have cross-trained their employees and moved sales people to the support desk to help transfer people to their new phones. Even with the long wait, the manager never did so, just stood around and talked with his sales people.The second time I was at the store, I'd gone because my Blackberry stopped working. The tech looked inside the phone and said that the indicator had gone off, indicating that the phone had gotten wet. I told him that it had never been near water, and what's more, it had never even been in a humid bathroom with a shower running. He told me I had to go through my insurance, rather than giving me a new phone, and I asked to speak to the manager. While speaking to the manager, she was unwilling to budge on the insurance claim, and wouldn't even give me the benefit of the doubt, given my 12+ year history with Verizon, and the fact that in the seven years I'd had equipment coverage, this was my first claim.These two experiences have made me never want to walk into another Verizon store again.

Our server was friendly and came to take our drinks. We told her we were ready to order dinner. Two of us ordered wings and two of us ordered Chicken Cheesesteaks. She looked at us like we were from outer space. Robot where's Will kinda outer space. She said she didn't think they had chicken cheesesteaks on their menu. We opened up the menus she had given us a few minutes earlier and showed her the Monday night chicken cheesesteak special. She asked if we wanted bleu cheese and celery with wings - yes. She asked if we wanted fries with the cheesesteaks - yes. She didn't mention the extra charge for this.There was exactly one other table - another family of four in the restaurant and only two people at the bar when we placed our order. It took 27 minutes for us to get two orders of wings and two chicken cheesesteaks. That seems like a long time to me.Wings were fine no complaints. My 8 year old who has a pretty well developed palette said the chicken was really dry. My husband agreed. We figured they used left over pre-cooked chicken from the weekend, diced it up and put melted cheese from a can on it. We were finished with our dinner and had to wait about 20 minutes more until our server came by. We asked for the check and a box for my left over wings. Ten minutes later she came back with the bill - no box but she would go get one. Our total bill was $55 plus tax. It should have been $32 plus tax. We tried to explain to her (another 5 minutes of this) why the bill was incorrect. She then said she would fix it.Ten minutes later - she came back and gave us the new bill. This time it was $52.My husband tried briefly to explain it again but I suggested we bring over a manager to get it resolved.More waiting and then John, the manager came by. We explained to him why the bill was incorrect. They overcharged me for my glass of wine, charged $1.13 per wing that should have been .39 cents per wing and overcharged on the chicken cheesesteaks that their own sign and menus priced at $5.00 each. We were charged for the bleu cheese, celery and fries - which was fine even though it's something that I think the server should mention and didn't. We explained to John we just wanted to get the bill fixed so we could pay and get out because we had lots to do with our daughters that night. Ten minutes later he showed up at our table and handed us the adjusted bill. He did not offer to comp anything or discount anything even though we spent 1 hour and 40 minutes there for simple wings and cheesesteaks with one other table being served when we ordered! It really annoyed me that he left the bill at our table and did not take the credit card that we placed right in front of him to run it through. He instead I suppose went to get our server. She did not appear so I went in the back serving station and found John. I had to tell him again we just wanted to pay the bill so we could leave.We will NEVER return here. Servers are not trained to know what is on their menu - not even the specific nightly specials. They over charged us for EVERYTHING. Service was exceptionally slow. Food took forever and was fair to average at best. The management did nothing to compensate for the experience and made it worse by not running our check through after we had waited way too long to pay them and leave.This was the second time we tried The Brick House. The first time the food was just average but service was better.

{"task_id": "T-NB4GH2", "business_name": "Gennaro's Tomato PIE", "user_query": "Draft a professional reply to this 1-star review for Gennaro's Tomato PIE: \"We visited Grace & Pat's on a Friday night around 7:30pm, and it was almost completely empty. We thought this was a bad sign, but decided to stay, because we had loved the pizza at their other location (Gennaro's Tomato Pie), and had been wanting to try Grace & Pat's since it opened.The first annoyance was that it was cash only, with no ATM on site. I know there's a tradition of Italian restaurants in South Philly being cash only, and Gennaro's is cash only, but it's still annoying. Nevertheless, we walked the several blocks to the CVS to get cash, and came back to the restaurant.Then, we saw the menu (http://media.philly.com/documents/Grace+and+Pat+Menu+In+house.pdf). Soda is $2.50 (no refills), and extra pizza toppings are $3 each (half or whole pie is the same price). Seriously? Not offering refills on a $2.50 soda is so ridiculous and inhospitable, and I've never seen a restaurant charge $3.00 for a topping like mushrooms or red onions. We were still being optimistic, however. If the pizza was as good as Gennaro's, it would be worth putting up with some hassle and nickle-and-diming. Unfortunately, the pizza was NOTHING like what we had experienced at Gennaro's. The crust wasn't crisp, it was actually tough. We both joked that we were going to need dental work after eating it. Not only was it tough, it tasted like it had been frozen. They also used the bare minimum of sauce and cheese on the pizza (the photo on their Facebook page looks nothing like the pizza that arrived at our table). I got the white pizza, and it was like a flat bread that someone had barely sprinkled cheese on, toasted, and then forgot in the toaster oven until it got tough.

We thought this was a bad sign, but decided to stay, because we had loved the pizza at their other location (Gennaro's Tomato Pie), and had been wanting to try Grace & Pat's since it opened.The first annoyance was that it was cash only, with no ATM on site. I know there's a tradition of Italian restaurants in South Philly being cash only, and Gennaro's is cash only, but it's still annoying. Nevertheless, we walked the several blocks to the CVS to get cash, and came back to the restaurant.Then, we saw the menu (http://media.philly.com/documents/Grace+and+Pat+Menu+In+house.pdf). Soda is $2.50 (no refills), and extra pizza toppings are $3 each (half or whole pie is the same price). Seriously? Not offering refills on a $2.50 soda is so ridiculous and inhospitable, and I've never seen a restaurant charge $3.00 for a topping like mushrooms or red onions. We were still being optimistic, however. If the pizza was as good as Gennaro's, it would be worth putting up with some hassle and nickle-and-diming. Unfortunately, the pizza was NOTHING like what we had experienced at Gennaro's. The crust wasn't crisp, it was actually tough. We both joked that we were going to need dental work after eating it. Not only was it tough, it tasted like it had been frozen. They also used the bare minimum of sauce and cheese on the pizza (the photo on their Facebook page looks nothing like the pizza that arrived at our table). I got the white pizza, and it was like a flat bread that someone had barely sprinkled cheese on, toasted, and then forgot in the toaster oven until it got tough.

The charity arm of the CCC is great. There were 15 possible charities to work with and a ton of money was raised. So yay!The race start was a little confusing to a novice like me. I knew you were supposed to be in your bib color start but late arrivers tried to run people over and get ahead of you. I mostly tried to keep out of the way and not get stepped on... There were fun bands/snacks/water along the way. And it was fun to see who costumed and who was in their serious running gear. For the record, my bunny ears were fine. My bunny leggings didn't breathe so well on that muggy day.The after party (to which you can purchase tickets) was fun but very muddy at the City Park festival grounds. We hung out for a bit and then wandered over to where we had left a 2nd car the night before. There were buses to take you back to start but the lines were long. Great run that goes through a good swath of the city. | This road race starts with 5 stars. I mean, running from the French Quarter to Mid City along some legendary streets and experiencing the unique sights, sounds and smells of the City with about 20,000 fellow runners is amazing in itself. The huge after party at City Park does this City, which is known for its parties, proud. So Kelly, you may ask, why are you only giving this event 3 stars? Well, on the very slim chance that an organizer of this event actually reads this I hope they take it for what it is - constructive criticism. For the record, I am a seasoned runner with many 10Ks under my belt so I do know a little about these. On to my issues...1. Overall course management leaves much to be desired. While many of these types of open runs are \"Organized chaos\" this one is simply chaotic. There should be more effort put into keeping groups (by groups I am referring to runners, joggers, walkers, etc) together instead of a mishmash of all types of participants. I would suggest more categories - (they seem to have this worked out well for the 40 minute and under finishers) but for those of us in 50 - 60 min categories, well, why not give us our own categories and actually enforce it? 2. Slow Joggers, Walkers, and Mommy Types pushing strollers along the route - PLEASE note a couple of things about race courtesy. Please don't walk more than two abreast. Please allow the runners to start ahead of you. Please be aware that runners will pass you and its considered bad behavior to call anyone passing you an \"asshole\". 3. Hydration stations - very poor organization. When you are running (or even walking) 6.2 miles in 80 plus degree weather hydration is very important. Efficient, clean, properly staffed hydration stations are important. Also I will note the sanitary conditions of at least one of the stations. Empty cups were lined up on a table. Water was emptied into a large garbage can. Race participants needing water had to take a cup and dip it into the garbage can of water to get a drink. Not healthy, folks. Not healthy.

Unfortunately for me, today was a miss!! From the start I felt that the student that was going to do my hair was inexperienced and not sure about anything. From the way the parted my hair for the coloring I should have known that this was not going to end well. Long story short, I left with a much darker hair that what we (the student, the instructor and myself) had agreed upon. I had a trim that was joke because the student was unable to do it herself so she called the instructor that \"did it\" in 2 minutes. I stayed there for 3 hours and not once was offered water. By the end I had such a headache I just wanted to get out of there. The instructors were not helpful at all by recognizing that the color was indeed not what I wanted, but not offering absolutely any solution.

I have struggled with acne my whole life and have tried every product and treatment you can imagine. My biggest issue now is the scaring that results from my years acne and with just one facial and one week use of their products, I notice less redness and my face is so much smoother. I have been able to go all week with little to no makeup! Nicole was incredible....sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about skin, especially while focusing on my specific skin concerns. I found the facial at Peaches to be even more relaxing then numerous ones that I have had in the past and the salon is beautiful and extremely clean. I just moved to LA, however I am so satisfied with my results so far that I'll continue to drive up to see Nicole for the amazing service and work! | I had my very first facial this weekend! I got a recommendation from a good friend of a great little privately owned spot in town. She also sent me a killer first timers deal:) After reading about the salon and really REALLY loving the website and info I had found, I made an appointment.I arrived a little early on Saturday AM to make sure I had time to fill out any paper work. When I arrived I fell in LOVE with the ambiance. There was a HUGE stone fireplace and the overall feeling was simple but well thought out.I was brought back into the treatment room where I was walked thru expectations. I realized quickly that this was not going to be what I thought it would be :) I mean that in the best way!The appointment started with a \"skin lesson\" from Diana. I actually can't believe how much I learned.See more here: http://selfprofessedproductobsessed.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/i-have-monistate-7-on-my-face/After the treatment, my aesthetician (Diana) took the last 15 mins to walk me thru the \"prescribed post treatment.\" I LOVE THIS CONSIDERATION! I love that she armed me with so much knowledge.My overall impressions of my treatment:1. I bought 4 more! I LOVE THIS PLACE and Diana2. By the end I was so inspired by this experience that I HONESTLY considered a career change! SERIOUSLY, she was that good.3. While I spend a lot of time and energy taking care of my skin, I know now that it wasn't enough and that I had so much mis-information.4. I believe in results more than relaxation :)5. I am committing to using natural products on my body moving forward. Did you know that some countries banned parabens in cosmetics?! (stand by for more info on parabens) As you can see from my small haul from Sephora, I picked up an all natural scrub and lotion, both by Pacifica.See more about Peaches products here: http://selfprofessedproductobsessed.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/peaches-products/", "citations_gt": ["CbIn5Vaua0yoYjD4rt4ojQ::reviews::keyword::facial"], "topic": "keyword_evidence", "difficulty": "medium", "keyword": "facial"}

The I won't review the apartment, but rather the company itself... so they have this 24 hr maintenance line... which is basically a call service. You leave a message like, \"hey, i got a gas leak\" (this really happened to me), and they say, \"sure, ill pass this on to them\"... you call an hour, two, three later...\"still got that gas leak\"... \"sorry sir, i left a message on their machine\"... eventually i called PGW, who finally fixed everything at 5 freaking am. Also had an upstairs neighbor who was out for the day leak on my apartment during the weekend... basically there was a flood from the ceiling, the whole day i was changing buckets, until he finally got home. I was leaving messages, emailing the WPRG owner (who was actually responding, but not sending anybody to help until the next monday morning). Finally got resolved when the neighbor got home and found half of his apartment destroyed (of course WPRG is not responsible for your personal belongings). And finally, this is what is happening to me now: a year ago they've sent me a letter that rent is being raised two months ahead of the cycle dictated by the contract. Somehow I let that slip by and paid higher rent for two months when I wasn't supposed to... now they are using that against me to say that my contract terminates two months earlier (june instead of august, which is whats written on paper). In summary, they will try to scam you given any opportunity, but as far as the apartment itself, it was fairly good for the price and location. The company itself is the problem! | If you want something done by this company, your going to call an answering machine. There is no email address or a paper trail of any kind which is highly convenient for the company. Expect to call several times. Expect to be hung up on when you explain your case. Expect the lease agreement to have the wrong address. Expect your apartment to be infested with roaches and mice upon move in. And dont bet on your apartment being ready when you move in either. Expect the central air to just blow air. And expect the negative attitudes to trickle down to the people who come by to fix your things too. After a few verbal altercations with the \"boss\", the little people who come by to actually do the work will turn nasty on you too. Its a very negative environment and living here is pretty miserable overall. I will say the apartment is very attractive otherwise and all the new kitchen is pretty awesome which is what sparked our attention. But dont expect service of any kind.

The space also gets rented out as a multi-purpose performance space so you may see other theater groups perform here from time to time. Check their website for the production schedule.From their website it says they've been nominated for many awards and have won quite a few too in just over a decade of existence. And from the quality of their performance, they probably deserved every one.Recently I went to see \"School for Wives\" by Moliere. It was excellent. The cast was magnificent and gave wonderful performances. They hit the style of Moliere right on the head with this show. The set and costuming were both well done. There is not much that I can say except that this being my first Lantern production it definitely made a positive impact and I will return to see another.The theater space itself if very interesting. It actually has two seating areas that form a right angle with the stage as the meeting point of the two sections. In addition, there is a proscenium arch against one of the back walls. Although, depending on the show, the space is used in many different ways.Lighting instruments are exposed from the grid above the stage and the stage is level with the first row of seats in each section. Some times the actors may even interact with the front rows. (For example, in the performance I went to, a patron got up and returned from the bathroom just as one of the actors came around the corner of the stage. The actor briefly danced with him (in character).)Seating is general admission and you will have to climb two flights of stairs to get up to the theater. The auditorium has two sections of raked seating. The sight lines are excellent no matter where you sit. The space is highly intimate with just over 100 seats.One draw back: Expect a line for the men's room. It's in the basement and there is only one stall and one urinal. It was like role reversal with the ladies room. | I had a great experience with this theater last week when visiting Philadelphia.

There really is a difference between okay food and great food, and this one probably serves its purpose but really nothing beyond that. I ordered the carne asada quesadilla, two crispy chicken tacos and the cheesecake. The crispy chicken tacos were pretty tasty and the price is right at 2.50 each, if you want it with guac and sour cream, expect to pay 4.50 each. Two bucks extra just for guac and sour cream. The quesadilla was just okay, it was a little chewy and not very crispy and the carne asada was pretty forgettable, with no spicing or flavor whatsoever.

If you are a non zoo member this will cost you $10 a person. This was my first time going to see the lights. I absolutely loved it. Each area of the zoo has a different theme of what the lights are. For example, in the Arctic area they are white and blue lights with light up animals. They do have some animals that you can see during the walk but not a lot. So if you are expecting to see lights and all the animals this event is not for you. My favorite thing since it was a cold night that they had a adult hot chocolate which you had an option of a shot of baileys or rum chutata. And they give you a good shot of it.

They're always running specials too. Plus it was quick service! It took an hour when compared to the past we usually had to wait over 3-4 hours to get him back. Our dog did wonderful and the staff were so great to him. Definitely taking my dog back here! Highly recommend this for your dog's grooming needs! | Just took my 5 puos there and I will be back.

My wife and I both ordered hot pots with broth option B, hot and spicy, with pork as the protein selection. We also ordered several add ons. The food was great, as was the service. The second time was a terrible experience. We ordered the same exact thing as the previous time. However, a few bites into our meal and we got a funny sensation in our mouth. We instantly realized what had happened. We ordered broth option B, but instead they had given us broth option A, which is the spicy Szechuan pepper broth. If you are unfamiliar with Szechuan pepper, it creates a numbing and tingling sensation in the mouth. I compare it to having lidocaine dumped into your mouth. Some people like it, but I absolutely hate it, which is why I never order it. I specifically ordered Broth B, and even pointed to it on the menu when our order was taken. After realizing that someone had screwed up the order, I asked the waitress who took our order whether or not our broth was the option B broth, or the A spicy Szechuan. She said it was spicy Szechuan. I told her that I had ordered B. She then went to the kitchen, came back, and told me that the broth was not Spicy Szechuan like she had initially said, but rather it was the hot and spicy broth (option B) that I had ordered. She then told me that the kitchen had said that both option A and B had Szechuan in them. I know that wasn't the case because I ordered the exact same thing 6 days before and it definitely DID NOT have Szechuan in it. I ate that entire dinner without any Szechuan sensation in my mouth. However with this dish, I had taken 5 bites and my mouth was already tingling. After that, she left our table and never came back. She didn't refill drinks, didn't check in. Just ignored us. We had to press the service button on the table to get our check after waiting for ages. She brought the check, and of course they charged us for the wrong orders. ISo to summarize, our order was screwed up. Shortly after receiving wrong order, I addressed the issue with the waitress. Then the waitress and/or kitchen lied about the screw up. Then we were ignored for the rest of the time. Finally, we ended up being charged for the wrong order, which I didn't even eat. My wife managed to eat about 1/3 of hers, but it just wasn't the same for her as the last time. It is not only bad practice to give someone a product they didn't order, lie about it, and then charge them for it, it is also unethical. This place does not operate an ethical establishment.

We instantly realized what had happened. We ordered broth option B, but instead they had given us broth option A, which is the spicy Szechuan pepper broth. If you are unfamiliar with Szechuan pepper, it creates a numbing and tingling sensation in the mouth. I compare it to having lidocaine dumped into your mouth. Some people like it, but I absolutely hate it, which is why I never order it. I specifically ordered Broth B, and even pointed to it on the menu when our order was taken. After realizing that someone had screwed up the order, I asked the waitress who took our order whether or not our broth was the option B broth, or the A spicy Szechuan. She said it was spicy Szechuan. I told her that I had ordered B. She then went to the kitchen, came back, and told me that the broth was not Spicy Szechuan like she had initially said, but rather it was the hot and spicy broth (option B) that I had ordered. She then told me that the kitchen had said that both option A and B had Szechuan in them. I know that wasn't the case because I ordered the exact same thing 6 days before and it definitely DID NOT have Szechuan in it. I ate that entire dinner without any Szechuan sensation in my mouth. However with this dish, I had taken 5 bites and my mouth was already tingling. After that, she left our table and never came back. She didn't refill drinks, didn't check in. Just ignored us. We had to press the service button on the table to get our check after waiting for ages. She brought the check, and of course they charged us for the wrong orders. ISo to summarize, our order was screwed up. Shortly after receiving wrong order, I addressed the issue with the waitress. Then the waitress and/or kitchen lied about the screw up. Then we were ignored for the rest of the time. Finally, we ended up being charged for the wrong order, which I didn't even eat. My wife managed to eat about 1/3 of hers, but it just wasn't the same for her as the last time. It is not only bad practice to give someone a product they didn't order, lie about it, and then charge them for it, it is also unethical. This place does not operate an ethical establishment. If you decide to order here, MAKE SURE THEY GET YOUR ORDER RIGHT from the start. Go over it several times, because if they screw it up, they will lie and leave you hanging.", "response_tone": "professional", "issues": ["service"]}

Tell you everything you want to hear, of course personable and friendly, cause it's their job. they really don't care about the person. They make the buying part a decent experience, until after the fact of course. Once they have your money they do not give a shit about you. They had supposedly done an inspection on the vehicle we bought before selling it to us, but of course we found issues almost right away. Trying to get them to fix these items was the worst experience. And they were items that should've been caught in the inspection, like a broken seatbelt. Had to make numerous trips back to the dealer for these repairs and they weren't apologetic at all for the hassles. Didn't offer to reimburse gas for all the trips.

EXPERIENCE I have ever had.My wife,18 month old son and myself stop by on a Saturday afternoon,I had been in contact through e-mail about a vehicle,so everything seemed fine we're talking to a salesman and we take the vehicle out for a quick test drive,we come back go into the salesmans office and he asked for my driver's licence,trade-in vehicle registration and he starts checking numbers on the vehicle then he suggests we take the vehicle home until monday so we reluctantly agree.So Sunday rolls around and we decide to take the vehicle back,we get there and I asked a manager if he could locate my keys for my vehicle that I left at the dealership so they could appraise my trade-in which they couldnt even be bothered to lock after I had left it there thinking it would be safe(stupid to have assumed they would have cared about customers vehicles i guess) the \"Manager\" tells me he is not a magician and he cannot locate my keys I will have to call my salesman to which he says with his Cell Phone in his hand \"do you have a cell on you if so i'll give you his number you can call him yourself\",so I call the salesman to which he says \"well you werent supposed to bring the vehicle back until tomorrow I have your keys,drivers licence and registration in my briefcase at home with me and I live 35 minutes away so can you come back tomorrow\" So I agree to come back tomorrow and give the salesman the benefit of the doubt.So Monday arrives The family is on our way back to the dealership,so we arrive I go in ask for our salesman 5 minutes goes by I ask for him again another 5 minutes goes by I ask again then the receptionist calls another Manager so he can go around and see if he can find the salesman to tell him his 5 O'clock APPOINTMENT is here,Lo and Behold the salesman has gone home for the night and he has taken all of my personal belongings home with him again,so with this salesman knowing my family and I were going out there for an APPOINTMENT he couldn't even be bothered to pick up the phone and say he wasn't available that day,so the other manager asks if we could come back tomorrow which would have made 3 days in a row of trying to get MY personal belongings back.Needless to say a third day was not happening,I arranged with the Manager to have the salesman drive my vehicle to my wife's work whenever he decided to show up to work again.So when he shows up to my wife's work he doesnt apologize for anything just starts telling her he had run the numbers and this is the deal he had worked out \"oh and one other thing\" he says\"I forgot the registration for your vehicle back at the dealership,do you think you guys can come out and get it later on this afternoon?\" My wife tells him \"no I want the registration today\" to which he says \"well is it Ok if i mail it to you\".Needless to say when he comes back the second time with still no apology he says to my wife \"well i guess we are even now since I have been here twice and you have been to the dealership twice\",then he continues to tell my wife when he went back to the dealership he worked out another deal on another vehicle, heres the numbers if you want to take a

They took my necklace to be repaired. When I went back to pick up the repaired necklace, I again noticed a small kink in the chain. The sales lady proceeds to tell me that I didn't purchase an insurance plan (or whatever they call it there) so I would have to pay for any further repairs. I was confused on why I would need to purchase insurance to repair something that had been poor quality from the beginning. I barely touched the jewelry so why would that be my responsibility. I took the necklace and left and will never return. I also made sure to point out to my boyfriend that if he ever plans on making a significant jewelry purchase, (between the quality and customer service) he should not visit this store.

However, the experience at Bacon didn't match my hopes. I don't think it's a constant, judging by other's reviews, but our particular food outing did not meet expectation.Pro's: We ordered the bacon shots appetizer, which was the best part of our meal. We did enjoy being able to have a sampler of the bacon specialties. My husband enjoyed the maple rosemary, I enjoyed the kurobata.Con's: I ordered cheese grits and a side of fruit. The cheese grits had all of the shredded cheese on top and it wasn't melted or interspersed in the grits. In fact, the shredded cheese was cold on the hot grits.My husband had the biscuits and gravy, the sausage gravy itself was excellent. However, the biscuit they served, they had cut in half and hid the burnt bottom of the biscuit. Also, the self-serve coffee was cold.I know that it is our responsibility as dining patrons to let the restaurant know if something is amiss, however, with so many problems, it just didn't feel worth it.Conclusion: I can see the vision and inspiration they are trying to achieve with this restaurant. However, the execution was lacking. | Bacon reminds me of almost every trendy restaurant in LA. The concept and atmosphere is suppose to distract you from the average trying too hard food. I had the French toast which was yummy and my fiancé had the breakfast burrito which he did enjoy. I liked their candied bacon the flavor was really nice.

Disgusted, we called over a waitress and asked for a new one which she did promptly. She got a second, freshly made omlette in about 5 minutes. I was hoping things would be smooth sailing from here but NOPE. After two, I repeat, TWO, freaking bites my friend made a face and stuck her tongue out, reaveling ANOTHER hair. This one was different. It was super long, definitely from someone's head. We both gagged and I pushed my omlette away.

I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance to try on wedding dresses. My godmother drove in from 2 hours away, my mother took off work early and one of my bridesmaids rearranged her schedule to attend the dress shopping session. When we arrived to the store they had a handmade sign on a scrap of paper saying they closed at 3:30 (scratched out) 2:30 p.m. that day. I could see two ladies through the window in the store so I knocked, thinking well maybe they closed to walk-ins but I had an appointment so surely they were expecting me. One of the women started to walk towards the door pointing to the sign saying they were closed. I said, \"but I have an appointment.\" She shook her head no and pointed to the sign. This went on for about a minute before she finally cracked the door open and said, \"we're closed.\" I repeated, \"but I have an appointment.\" And she tells me, \"No you don't.\" Which blew me away. I know I made the appointment I had a 10 minute conversation with the woman on the phone when I made the appointment. I reassure her I have an appointment and she once again tells me \"No you don't. Are you sure you actually made an appointment.\" The woman just kept repeating we're closed there is no one here to help you. And telling me I didn't have an appointment. She made zero efforts to resolve the situation. She didn't offer to reschedule my appointment or even invite us in to discuss options. She had a very bad attitude and was super unfriendly. She was very rude and clearly didn't care to have our business. Save yourself the trouble and visit a store that cares about their customers. | I have to second everything said by Rachel S. I bought a deb gown here several years ago and the service then was very frigid. They only seem to perk up once you agree to buy a dress which I think is ridiculous. Now I'm getting married and although I no longer live in NO, I called in while I was in town visiting family to see if they had a dress I was interested in trying on. They were extremely rude to me on the phone and instructed me to send them an email with the exact style #. I asked for the email address and she said \"well it's the same as the online website - www.townandcountrybridal.com\" When I pointed out that that was a web address and NOT an email address, she rudely put me hold and got someone else who was not an idiot to tell me the email address. Ultimately, I decided not to bother even going in there since I was confident I would find a dress that I love close to where I live in San Francisco (where the service was much better).I think this place has some really beautiful gowns and I think it's worth a stop in if you live in New Orleans which has relatively few bridal salons (I'd also stop by Wedding Belles and Mimi Vera Wang which were great). The service at T & C has got to improve though.

The owner was conscientious--he kept an eye on things, and made sure we were completely satisfied. But the workers themselves made sure they did a good job! They could not have been more clean and careful, inside and out. We had star bolts put in, which meant they had to cut holes in the living room ceiling. They hung plastic and put down drop-cloths, and since they had to work over three days, the plastic had to be taken down and then put back in place every single day, so we could use our front door. They were always cheerful, polite, and terribly pleasant. The ceiling looked as good as new when they were done. The outside work involved repointing and repairing and recoating the stucco. The job was done impeccably. Our neighbours were very impressed. So are we. We'd use them again in a heartbeat. | Bad experience with this company on two occasions, but didn't know the first experience was so bad until after the second. I'll explain. Years ago this company was hired to do extensive work on a building that was being renovated for condos. Lots of brick pointing and facade work on a building that had been vacant for many years, but was beautiful nonetheless. The bill for the work was huge, but just a few years later new residents were having lots of water problems. The roof was blamed over and over, but it was not the roof. The pointing in the rear of the building was so poorly done it was shocking. Later it was recalled that an early resident overheard a foreman (from WM Proud) on the job telling the crew to just make the first two floors look good and that no one would notice the work (or lack of work) on the upper floors looking up from the street. Turned out the whole building had to be redone, it wasn't just the back that was done poorly all of it was bad. This company was paid a fortune for this job. Before this problem was uncovered I had personally hired them to do some facade work and cleaning on a building and the consultant could not have been nicer, more helpful or accessible while I was deciding on whether or not to sign the contract. Once I signed he was gone and I was stuck with a guy who showed up when he wanted (even though it was promised that they would schedule times to perform work and show up on time). The work was started then stopped, started and then stopped. About 95% finished and then I had to beg them to come back and finish the work. I thought maybe I had just been unlucky or not much of a priority because the second job was small (although not inexpensive), but then when I discovered that the work they performed just a few years ago on the first project had to be completely redone and what had been said about only paying attention to the lower floors I felt compelled to write this review. The company has cost a lot of people a lot of money and wasted energy when it was not necessary. I will never use them again or recommend them obviously.", "citations_gt": ["jDpTvYGJWqjIHw5OQKBINw::reviews::keyword::work"], "topic": "keyword_evidence", "difficulty": "medium", "keyword": "work"}

I just got an estimate to fix the bullnose laminate floor (not expensive) on my steps and called 4 friends moving today to see what we could work out. Well it must have been my mistake to call and speak with someone about splitting the repair. Mr. Important answered the phone Jim Fischer, at least that's what he told me, he's pretty important around here when I asked his name and position. (After he was quite short and abrupt) As a consumer and previous business owner I am truly amazed at the behavior of this man. Before I hired them, they were sending me emails, text messages and calling me daily to see if I was ready to move. Now, they aren't even interested in resolving a very small issue. Don't use them. I looked them up in sunbiz.org and they are formerly many other moving companies from Boca Raton. They keep changing their name, probably from bad reviews. Do your research before you hire a moving company. Feel free to make it right Mr. Important and I will be happy to let the public know you did the right thing.

I never had any problem with customer service, and the one time I lost power, I received constant texts from Trico updating me on the status. I liked that. | For an internet service provider, if you have another choice-take it! I ordered a disconnect of my service today. Sometimes you have to settle for what you can get when you live beyond cable and DSL lines but when trips to use the library's wi-fi and using a 3G network on a smartphone out perform what they can deliver it's time to pull the plug.They \"guarantee\" certain minimum speed levels but dodge the issue once your own speed tests and usage prove they are less than adequate. There is a guarantee of service but no recourse, credits or compensation for repeated shortcomings.The internet is offered by Trico but run by Transworld Network. Check out their website at twncorp.com. The copyright on the website is 2009 and their billing system is so poor you can never rely on how much you owe when looking at it. When you log in it is like dealing with a website from a decade ago. This should tell you something right there. Last I heard the credit card processing through their website is just a portal for your information to be pulled and run manually. For a technology company they should be ashamed. The staff may seems \"nice\" but they will not document some calls, lie about making follow-up calls and mostly support a very poor product with a worse system. If you're just checking your social media sites and e-mail their service may be sufficient but don't expect the performance and support if you are running a business, gaming or have any other normal demands.

Amala was adopted in Miami approximately three years ago at roughly seven months of age, her life prior to rescue was nothing less than haunting. While living in South Florida, we had a wonderful Vet, accompanied by an equivalent Veterinary office staff who were trustworthy and made Amala feel secure. When we relocated to PA, we unfortunately had to find a new Vet.We tried a Vet closer to us in Downingtown, PA, but we weren't impressed. Amala was anxious while visiting, the Vet and staff did not seem compassionate or patient and the visits were expensive! Having a great Veterinary experience in Florida, I was determined to find the same here in PA.When Amala woke up in the middle of the night, restless, anxious and crying, I immediately assumed she was experiencing memories of her past. The next day, after our morning walk, Amala was again, anxious and crying. Although I wanted to stay home and make sure Amala was okay, Amala spends her days with Poppa (my dad), and in the event that anything should arise, Poppa would be right there to save the day!After arriving to work, I called to check in. Poppa and Amala were in Eagle/Chester Springs and Amala was crying in the background. Refusing to have Amala seen by the previous Vet in Downingtown, I searched for Vets nearby. At 9:30AM, I called LCVH and spoke with Aviva who was professional, patient and understanding. Aviva was able to schedule an appointment for 11:50AM!Vet Tech, Rachel, went over Amala's history and Dr. Harclerode performed a thorough exam. It was determined that Amala was actually in pain and she was prescribed medicine. After getting home from work, I discussed Amala's appointment with my dad. My dad reported on the compassion and care at LCVH. At 5:00PM, I called LCVH to thank Aviva for her assistance and to advise of the positive impact that was made upon my dad. Aviva put me on a brief hold and suddenly I was speaking with Dr. Harclerode for twenty plus minutes, expressing my gratitude for the hospitality in caring for Amala, regarding at-home care and regarding some missing information from Amala's prior records.Over the weekend, Amala's injury became worse. I called LCVH first thing Monday morning and spoke with Kortney who booked a follow up appt with Dr. Harclerode on Tuesday. Les than thirty minutes later, Gabriella called back to advise that there had been a cancellation and Amala could be seen later that day. At the follow up appt, Amala was greeted with much excitement from the reception staff. Vet tech, Brie, notated a brief recap of what occurred over the weekend, and advised that Dr. Harclerode would be in momentarily to see us. Dr. Harclerode suddenly had to respond to an emergency appt; however, Brie kept us apprise as to status.Dr. Harclerode again examined Amala to determine whether X-rays were necessary. Amala responded after some manipulation, and she was diagnosed with a strain of the right iliopsoas, ouch! Dr. Harclerode determined X-rays were not necessary and she prescribed Amala with a muscle relaxer to help with discomfort and provided some at-home PT exercises for recovery. Not only was I relieved that Dr. Harclerode was able to rule out a more serious injury, Dr. Harclerode did so without any added expense. In only two visits in four days' time, I am overjoyed to be able to say we have finally found a Vet AND an entire staff who exhibits the same qualities, compassion and care of the Vet and staff we grew to know and love in Florida. From initial telephone call to LCVH, to checkout at Amala's follow up appointment, I never once felt as though we were \"new\" to LCVH, or anything less than family. The cost for Amala's care and treatment, inclusive of meds, were reasonable and trivial in comparison to previous Vet that Amala had seen in Downingtown. Dr. Harclerode and LCVH staff offered exceptional care, unremarkable customer service and unsurpassed solicitude.I highly recommend Dr. Harclerode and LCVH!", "citations_gt": ["qy_BTJAND9Utkmrkz1ocUg::reviews::keyword::amala"], "topic": "keyword_evidence", "difficulty": "medium", "keyword": "amala"}

Personally, I hate restaurants where Service and the Food Quality are sub-par but prices are inflated to help elevate the perception... This is definitely one of those restaurants.My family and I had dinner at Rusty's on New Year's eve 2015... The service was Poor (with a capital P). The $35 and up entrees were 99% the same items that were on the buffet. Food was cold and bland in the buffet (I know this because my children had the buffet), and Food was cold and bland as entrees... unfixable!We had a crabby and ill-mannered old server who hates children and it so clearly showed on his face we felt sick to be there (and no, my children were not loud or running around, they sat through the whole torture session with something close to a smile on their face).Will not be returning to Rusty's Bistro.Oh, I almost forgot: The music was nice and this review does not reflect on the excellent pianist that played all night long. He was amazing! | Menu provides great options if you want to go pricey and nice, or if you want to keep it more budget friendly (as far as possible in a nice hotel restaurant).We ordered from the prix fixe menu. For $30 you get a starter, main, and a dessert. It was plenty of food, and it was all delicious. I had a rack of lamb and my partner had the filet mignon. Each came with mashed potatoes (buttery and creamy), asparagus, and sweet potato puree.Decent wines are a bit expensive. We went with a cheaper bottle and it was just okay, but we would like to see the wine options expand with more affordable and decent bottles.They also offer a buffet on some nights. We did not try it recently, but in the past it has been decent. Based on past experience, the hot dishes tend to suffer from sitting, however.It was a Saturday night and they had a pianist sing and playing a keyboard. It added a nice touch.If you are looking for a good meal in a nice atmosphere, then check out Rusty's.

Julie Vanderbrook, the church's director was absolutely awful to work with. When booking this church know that if you are not a parishioner you will \"need to find your own priest.\" Ok, understandable. They do many weddings and the priest would never catch a break, but being an out of town bride I asked Ms. Vanderbrook if she had a list of priests in the area that may be able to officiate our ceremony. Her response was \"No, I guess you'll have to find someone who lives here to help you out.\" The night of the rehearsal I arrived 10 minutes late, yes I understand that was rude, but she told my mother \"oh well, we are starting without her!\" It was a stressful time with many moving parts and I apologized. She ran through the rehearsal one time and expected everyone to get it. We were out of there in 20 minutes. No one really knew what they were supposed to do. She didn't explain herself well and we all felt very rushed.The day of the wedding she was an absolute nightmare. Our wedding started at 7:00 and guests who arrived at 6:55 were told, by Ms. Vanderbrook, \"You are late!\". My husband wanted to escort his sister down the aisle and at 6:40 she started rushing him telling him to go go go, finally he had to look at her and say, no one is even here yet, I'm not walking her down. So she continued to nag and he ignored her. Now what really sent me over the edge was how I found out she treated my mother. It was 6:45 and because the church doesn't have a bridal room we had to get a room at the hotel across the street and since we were so rushed through the rehearsal and I was a nervous bride I didn't realize I was supposed to be there at 6:45 and to be completely honest, I didn't want to be standing around while people filed in and see me in my dress before I walked down the aisle. My bridesmaids and I arrived at 6:58. At 6:45 this woman had my mother in TEARS. She was incessantly asking my mother, \"Where is your daughter?! Where is your daughter?! She is so rude!\" There were many of instances that she was rude to guests and family members but I'd be writing for days.A wedding is already stressful enough and all Ms. Vanderbrook did was add to the stress and really, escalate it. I do understand that it is New Orleans and you deal with people who may not be considerate but no one in our party was rude, drunk, loud, etc. There was absolutely no reason for this woman to act the way she did. I honestly don't understand why she is the director of weddings at Immaculate Conception. We fully intend to write a letter to the priest and bishop to let them know how she is running the weddings at this church. For the amount of money you pay to get married there, you should not be treated like garbage. | This is a beautiful old church right off of Canal Street. It has these wonderful pews made of wood and iron and impressive stained glass windows. There are several Mass times and refreshments after most Sunday services if you would like to grab coffee, touch bases with a priest, or chat up members and visitors. Besides its beauty, it has many needed ministries for the community. The Harry Tompson Center helps the poor and homeless (http://www.harrytompsoncenter.org/) with the basic needs we take for granted. They even help with mental and legal services. The church is involved with the St. Vincent de Paul Society which offers rental and utility assistance. It has its own tuition-free school for at-risk kids (http://thegoodshepherdschool.org/) and helps support Cafe Reconcile (http://reconcileneworleans.org/) founded by Father Tompson and others. It \"is a nonprofit organization providing at-risk youth (16-22) with opportunities to learn life, interpersonal, and work skills for success.\" It is a culinary training program and is open for lunch service to the public. You can even volunteer online for many of these places (http://76.12.167.60/volunteerform.htm) before your visit!The church also conducts tours the last Saturday of each month (except December) at 3pm if you are interested in hearing about its interesting history (http://jesuitchurch.net/) such as when the church had to be completely disassembled and rebuilt, brick by brick, because of another building's construction.", "citations_gt": ["4itYXwG099-m6lV4u715hQ::reviews::keyword::church"], "topic": "keyword_evidence", "difficulty": "medium", "keyword": "church"}

I feel like we lucked out because we got there around 830ish on a Friday night and were able to snag one of the big wooden booths. I had the old fashioned and it was pretty good. Like others have written about, the attention to the local Arizona detail is what really sets this place apart. If most nights also have around the amount of people tonight did, I think it also really hits the spot since it wasn't crowded and was just a lovely hang. Recommend! | I live Good Oak because it represents a reprieve that characterizes living in the Sonoran Desert. Here's why Good Oak is my favorite Tucson bar:1. Craft: I'm drawn to establishments that develop a craft identity, where the bartenders, for example, can tell me why and how certain flavors develop during fermentation. And where the local vineyards whose products are for sale actually come in for tastings. I'm drawn to Good Oak because the bartenders seem to know and care about what *I* like and they've never recommended something I didn't enjoy. Sometimes I don't feel like just a customer here, not because the staff are friendly, but because when I go into Good Oak I almost feel like I've escaped consumer culture--and that's a kind of reprieve you won't often find (the caveat, however, is that this isn't the cheapest joint in town).Maybe it's the novelty of their beer presses, or the almost hidden location, but this doesn't come together feeling like a bar in a busy downtown area. Maybe it's that it seems like Good Oak cares as much about the alcohol as it does about the customer. It's this atmosphere that makes it idiosyncratically cozy (really, Im just a sucker for the metal and the wood accents). 2. Discreet: Even though it's located downtown, it isn't swarming with Coors Light-soaked undergrads. In fact, it's almost hidden in plain sight. I like to come here with my colleagues for relief drinking after long days at work. It can get loud, but it's mostly pretty reasonable. 3. Arizona local: GO serves beer and wine sourced from Arizona. I love the wine selections, and though they're not necessarily cheap ($8-12/glass), they're *all* excellent, locally-sourced. On a recent visit, I started with the xo coffee stout and finished with a Dragoon IPA, which left me delightfully woozy. And while you can now find Dragoon brews in a number of establishments around Tucson, and the selection of swill isn't quite as wide as say, 1702, it's leas about the breadth of selection than the reason for it. If you'd like drink somewhere that's discreet and comfortably idiosyncratic, I'd highly recommend Good Oak", "citations_gt": ["bCIZeggW02uPdz2lobSjUA::reviews::keyword::good"], "topic": "keyword_evidence", "difficulty": "medium", "keyword": "good"}
