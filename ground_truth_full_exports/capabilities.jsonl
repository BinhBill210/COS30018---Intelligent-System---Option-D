Our server was friendly and came to take our drinks. We told her we were ready to order dinner. Two of us ordered wings and two of us ordered Chicken Cheesesteaks. She looked at us like we were from outer space. Robot where's Will kinda outer space. She said she didn't think they had chicken cheesesteaks on their menu. We opened up the menus she had given us a few minutes earlier and showed her the Monday night chicken cheesesteak special. She asked if we wanted bleu cheese and celery with wings - yes. She asked if we wanted fries with the cheesesteaks - yes. She didn't mention the extra charge for this.There was exactly one other table - another family of four in the restaurant and only two people at the bar when we placed our order. It took 27 minutes for us to get two orders of wings and two chicken cheesesteaks. That seems like a long time to me.Wings were fine no complaints. My 8 year old who has a pretty well developed palette said the chicken was really dry. My husband agreed. We figured they used left over pre-cooked chicken from the weekend, diced it up and put melted cheese from a can on it. We were finished with our dinner and had to wait about 20 minutes more until our server came by. We asked for the check and a box for my left over wings. Ten minutes later she came back with the bill - no box but she would go get one. Our total bill was $55 plus tax. It should have been $32 plus tax. We tried to explain to her (another 5 minutes of this) why the bill was incorrect. She then said she would fix it.Ten minutes later - she came back and gave us the new bill. This time it was $52.My husband tried briefly to explain it again but I suggested we bring over a manager to get it resolved.More waiting and then John, the manager came by. We explained to him why the bill was incorrect. They overcharged me for my glass of wine, charged $1.13 per wing that should have been .39 cents per wing and overcharged on the chicken cheesesteaks that their own sign and menus priced at $5.00 each. We were charged for the bleu cheese, celery and fries - which was fine even though it's something that I think the server should mention and didn't. We explained to John we just wanted to get the bill fixed so we could pay and get out because we had lots to do with our daughters that night. Ten minutes later he showed up at our table and handed us the adjusted bill. He did not offer to comp anything or discount anything even though we spent 1 hour and 40 minutes there for simple wings and cheesesteaks with one other table being served when we ordered! It really annoyed me that he left the bill at our table and did not take the credit card that we placed right in front of him to run it through. He instead I suppose went to get our server. She did not appear so I went in the back serving station and found John. I had to tell him again we just wanted to pay the bill so we could leave.We will NEVER return here. Servers are not trained to know what is on their menu - not even the specific nightly specials. They over charged us for EVERYTHING. Service was exceptionally slow. Food took forever and was fair to average at best. The management did nothing to compensate for the experience and made it worse by not running our check through after we had waited way too long to pay them and leave.This was the second time we tried The Brick House. The first time the food was just average but service was better. The first time the kids ordered the Fried Oreo dessert - it sounded good but it was so disgusting they would not eat it - it tasted of burnt oil.

I know there's a tradition of Italian restaurants in South Philly being cash only, and Gennaro's is cash only, but it's still annoying. Nevertheless, we walked the several blocks to the CVS to get cash, and came back to the restaurant.Then, we saw the menu (http://media.philly.com/documents/Grace+and+Pat+Menu+In+house.pdf). Soda is $2.50 (no refills), and extra pizza toppings are $3 each (half or whole pie is the same price). Seriously? Not offering refills on a $2.50 soda is so ridiculous and inhospitable, and I've never seen a restaurant charge $3.00 for a topping like mushrooms or red onions. We were still being optimistic, however. If the pizza was as good as Gennaro's, it would be worth putting up with some hassle and nickle-and-diming. Unfortunately, the pizza was NOTHING like what we had experienced at Gennaro's. The crust wasn't crisp, it was actually tough. We both joked that we were going to need dental work after eating it. Not only was it tough, it tasted like it had been frozen. They also used the bare minimum of sauce and cheese on the pizza (the photo on their Facebook page looks nothing like the pizza that arrived at our table). I got the white pizza, and it was like a flat bread that someone had barely sprinkled cheese on, toasted, and then forgot in the toaster oven until it got tough. My boyfriend got the red pizza and the sauce was cold in some places, and it was also topped with very little cheese. Same tough, frozen-tasting crust. Grace and Pat's gets 1 star for the appearance of the restaurant, and the very nice waitstaff. The restaurant is really cute, the music is at a nice volume, and the waitstaff are very pleasant and attentive. If they brought over the recipes from Gennaro's this place would get 5 stars, even if they stayed cash only and were stingy with soda refills.

They got my information and saw that I was in their system as regular Firestone client. They were to call me when ready.3.5 hours later i got the call that the tire was not fixable and that I had to get a new one. They could not help me though until I brought the car back for them to see all tires.I mentioned that the tire was deemed fixable by AAA and that my tires were in the system as I bought them all from a Firestone tire shop in Missouri. Still no asssitance from the man that kept telling g me how busy they were.I picked up the tire by 3 pm , left the shop and went to another tire place closest from that shop. They fix the tire in 15mn, balanced it , installed it and place the spare back in the trunk. They charged me $30. I waited 2 weeks before writing this review as I wanted to make sure that the tire held off properly. I left st louis for southern Missouri the following day and drove 250 miles without an issue.

The second time was a terrible experience. We ordered the same exact thing as the previous time. However, a few bites into our meal and we got a funny sensation in our mouth. We instantly realized what had happened. We ordered broth option B, but instead they had given us broth option A, which is the spicy Szechuan pepper broth.

After realizing that someone had screwed up the order, I asked the waitress who took our order whether or not our broth was the option B broth, or the A spicy Szechuan. She said it was spicy Szechuan. I told her that I had ordered B. She then went to the kitchen, came back, and told me that the broth was not Spicy Szechuan like she had initially said, but rather it was the hot and spicy broth (option B) that I had ordered. She then told me that the kitchen had said that both option A and B had Szechuan in them. I know that wasn't the case because I ordered the exact same thing 6 days before and it definitely DID NOT have Szechuan in it. I ate that entire dinner without any Szechuan sensation in my mouth.

and myself stop by on a Saturday afternoon,I had been in contact through e-mail about a vehicle,so everything seemed fine we're talking to a salesman and we take the vehicle out for a quick test drive,we come back go into the salesmans office and he asked for my driver's licence,trade-in vehicle registration and he starts checking numbers on the vehicle then he suggests we take the vehicle home until monday so we reluctantly agree.So Sunday rolls around and we decide to take the vehicle back,we get there and I asked a manager if he could locate my keys for my vehicle that I left at the dealership so they could appraise my trade-in which they couldnt even be bothered to lock after I had left it there thinking it would be safe(stupid to have assumed they would have cared about customers vehicles i guess) the \"Manager\" tells me he is not a magician and he cannot locate my keys I will have to call my salesman to which he says with his Cell Phone in his hand \"do you have a cell on you if so i'll give you his number you can call him yourself\",so I call the salesman to which he says \"well you werent supposed to bring the vehicle back until tomorrow I have your keys,drivers licence and registration in my briefcase at home with me and I live 35 minutes away so can you come back tomorrow\" So I agree to come back tomorrow and give the salesman the benefit of the doubt.So Monday arrives The family is on our way back to the dealership,so we arrive I go in ask for our salesman 5 minutes goes by I ask for him again another 5 minutes goes by I ask again then the receptionist calls another Manager so he can go around and see if he can find the salesman to tell him his 5 O'clock APPOINTMENT is here,Lo and Behold the salesman has gone home for the night and he has taken all of my personal belongings home with him again,so with this salesman knowing my family and I were going out there for an APPOINTMENT he couldn't even be bothered to pick up the phone and say he wasn't available that day,so the other manager asks if we could come back tomorrow which would have made 3 days in a row of trying to get MY personal belongings back.Needless to say a third day was not happening,I arranged with the Manager to have the salesman drive my vehicle to my wife's work whenever he decided to show up to work again.So when he shows up to my wife's work he doesnt apologize for anything just starts telling her he had run the numbers and this is the deal he had worked out \"oh and one other thing\" he says\"I forgot the registration for your vehicle back at the dealership,do you think you guys can come out and get it later on this afternoon?\" My wife tells him \"no I want the registration today\" to which he says \"well is it Ok if i mail it to you\".Needless to say when he comes back the second time with still no apology he says to my wife \"well i guess we are even now since I have been here twice and you have been to the dealership twice\",then he continues to tell my wife when he went back to the dealership he worked out another deal on another vehicle, heres the numbers if you want to take a look.So if you think this is how you shoud be treated when making a major purchase in your life then I guess this disaster of a place is right for you,but if you would like to be treated with a little bit of respect dont go near this

by I ask for him again another 5 minutes goes by I ask again then the receptionist calls another Manager so he can go around and see if he can find the salesman to tell him his 5 O'clock APPOINTMENT is here,Lo and Behold the salesman has gone home for the night and he has taken all of my personal belongings home with him again,so with this salesman knowing my family and I were going out there for an APPOINTMENT he couldn't even be bothered to pick up the phone and say he wasn't available that day,so the other manager asks if we could come back tomorrow which would have made 3 days in a row of trying to get MY personal belongings back.Needless to say a third day was not happening,I arranged with the Manager to have the salesman drive my vehicle to my wife's work whenever he decided to show up to work again.So when he shows up to my wife's work he doesnt apologize for anything just starts telling her he had run the numbers and this is the deal he had worked out \"oh and one other thing\" he says\"I forgot the registration for your vehicle back at the dealership,do you think you guys can come out and get it later on this afternoon?\" My wife tells him \"no I want the registration today\" to which he says \"well is it Ok if i mail it to you\".Needless to say when he comes back the second time with still no apology he says to my wife \"well i guess we are even now since I have been here twice and you have been to the dealership twice\",then he continues to tell my wife when he went back to the dealership he worked out another deal on another vehicle, heres the numbers if you want to take a look.So if you think this is how you shoud be treated when making a major purchase in your life then I guess this disaster of a place is right for you,but if you would like to be treated with a little bit of respect dont go near this little shop of horrors.NightDealershi", "response_tone": "professional"}, "optional": false}]}

Well, actually, after the first experience all I really hoped was that they could at least provide a clean meal. I really wasn't asking for anything exceptional and somehow the second experience was worse than the first. The first time I visited BACON was for brunch with my husband. I ordered the classic buscuits and sausage gravy. While the meal did taste good while eating it, my stomach did not have a good rest of the day. I walked out feeling bloated and gross. Even worse? 9 hours later I was still burping and tasting the gravy I had eaten that morning. Way too greasy. Storytime! The second time I visited BACON I actually chose it and asked my friend to meet me there. Biggest mistake ever that left my friend sick to her stomach and I embarrassed and disgusted. After making our way through the super crowded ordering booth (which, by the way, is the stupidest set up ever), we sat at the only table available even though it was covered in the last attendee's meal. It wasn't until we were delivered our food the waitress noticed how grody the table was and cleaned it up AFTER setting our food down on it. Yes, I expected her to take it back, come back with a clean cloth, wipe the table and re-serve is our food, when I'm paying $12 for an omlette and fruit. The nightmare didn't stop there...My wonderful friend and I ordered vegetable omelettes. with a side of fruit. It tasted great until a couple bites in and my friend noticed something funky in her omlette. It turned out to be a freaking thick piece of hair. It looked very pube-like. Disgusted, we called over a waitress and asked for a new one which she did promptly. She got a second, freshly made omlette in about 5 minutes. I was hoping things would be smooth sailing from here but NOPE. After two, I repeat, TWO, freaking bites my friend made a face and stuck her tongue out, reaveling ANOTHER hair. This one was different. It was super long, definitely from someone's head. We both gagged and I pushed my omlette away. Hell no did I believe I was eating a clean plate when both of my friend's had hairs. I was so pissed at this point I got up and stormed to the stupid ordering booth and demanded a refund. To make up for the disaster the manager did gift me a $15 gift card that I probably won't be using. One hair is something I can get past if fixed but TWO?! Don't you guys have any kind of quality assurance or sanitary protocols?! Do your chefs wear hair nets?! Note also, the hairs weren't on the surface on the omlette, they were embedded within them, meaning they were cooked after the hairs made their way into the food. I should have grabbed pictures of the hairs but after the second one I was so disgusted the only thing on my mind was getting my refund and dipping out. I won't be using that $15 gift card, I'd rather pay for clean food than eat free, unsanitary, disgusting hairy food. Sorry If this review is so long but I had to get everything in. BACON, you guys showcase your business as a high-class, modern eatery. That, coupled with your high prices, means you should be delivering exceptional customer service and quality meals.

When booking this church know that if you are not a parishioner you will \"need to find your own priest.\" Ok, understandable. They do many weddings and the priest would never catch a break, but being an out of town bride I asked Ms. Vanderbrook if she had a list of priests in the area that may be able to officiate our ceremony. Her response was \"No, I guess you'll have to find someone who lives here to help you out.\" The night of the rehearsal I arrived 10 minutes late, yes I understand that was rude, but she told my mother \"oh well, we are starting without her!\" It was a stressful time with many moving parts and I apologized. She ran through the rehearsal one time and expected everyone to get it. We were out of there in 20 minutes. No one really knew what they were supposed to do. She didn't explain herself well and we all felt very rushed.The day of the wedding she was an absolute nightmare.

My husband wanted to escort his sister down the aisle and at 6:40 she started rushing him telling him to go go go, finally he had to look at her and say, no one is even here yet, I'm not walking her down. So she continued to nag and he ignored her. Now what really sent me over the edge was how I found out she treated my mother. It was 6:45 and because the church doesn't have a bridal room we had to get a room at the hotel across the street and since we were so rushed through the rehearsal and I was a nervous bride I didn't realize I was supposed to be there at 6:45 and to be completely honest, I didn't want to be standing around while people filed in and see me in my dress before I walked down the aisle. My bridesmaids and I arrived at 6:58. At 6:45 this woman had my mother in TEARS. She was incessantly asking my mother, \"Where is your daughter?! Where is your daughter?! She is so rude!\" There were many of instances that she was rude to guests and family members but I'd be writing for days.A wedding is already stressful enough and all Ms. Vanderbrook did was add to the stress and really, escalate it. I do understand that it is New Orleans and you deal with people who may not be considerate but no one in our party was rude, drunk, loud, etc. There was absolutely no reason for this woman to act the way she did. I honestly don't understand why she is the director of weddings at Immaculate Conception.

So she continued to nag and he ignored her. Now what really sent me over the edge was how I found out she treated my mother. It was 6:45 and because the church doesn't have a bridal room we had to get a room at the hotel across the street and since we were so rushed through the rehearsal and I was a nervous bride I didn't realize I was supposed to be there at 6:45 and to be completely honest, I didn't want to be standing around while people filed in and see me in my dress before I walked down the aisle. My bridesmaids and I arrived at 6:58. At 6:45 this woman had my mother in TEARS. She was incessantly asking my mother, \"Where is your daughter?! Where is your daughter?! She is so rude!\" There were many of instances that she was rude to guests and family members but I'd be writing for days.A wedding is already stressful enough and all Ms. Vanderbrook did was add to the stress and really, escalate it. I do understand that it is New Orleans and you deal with people who may not be considerate but no one in our party was rude, drunk, loud, etc. There was absolutely no reason for this woman to act the way she did. I honestly don't understand why she is the director of weddings at Immaculate Conception. We fully intend to write a letter to the priest and bishop to let them know how she is running the weddings at this church. For the amount of money you pay to get married there, you should not be treated like garbage.", "response_tone": "professional"}, "optional": false}]}
