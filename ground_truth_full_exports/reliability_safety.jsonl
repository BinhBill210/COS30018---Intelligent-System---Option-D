Our server was friendly and came to take our drinks. We told her we were ready to order dinner. Two of us ordered wings and two of us ordered Chicken Cheesesteaks. She looked at us like we were from outer space. Robot where's Will kinda outer space. She said she didn't think they had chicken cheesesteaks on their menu. We opened up the menus she had given us a few minutes earlier and showed her the Monday night chicken cheesesteak special. She asked if we wanted bleu cheese and celery with wings - yes. She asked if we wanted fries with the cheesesteaks - yes. She didn't mention the extra charge for this.There was exactly one other table - another family of four in the restaurant and only two people at the bar when we placed our order. It took 27 minutes for us to get two orders of wings and two chicken cheesesteaks. That seems like a long time to me.Wings were fine no complaints. My 8 year old who has a pretty well developed palette said the chicken was really dry. My husband agreed. We figured they used left over pre-cooked chicken from the weekend, diced it up and put melted cheese from a can on it. We were finished with our dinner and had to wait about 20 minutes more until our server came by. We asked for the check and a box for my left over wings. Ten minutes later she came back with the bill - no box but she would go get one. Our total bill was $55 plus tax. It should have been $32 plus tax. We tried to explain to her (another 5 minutes of this) why the bill was incorrect. She then said she would fix it.Ten minutes later - she came back and gave us the new bill. This time it was $52.My husband tried briefly to explain it again but I suggested we bring over a manager to get it resolved.More waiting and then John, the manager came by. We explained to him why the bill was incorrect. They overcharged me for my glass of wine, charged $1.13 per wing that should have been .39 cents per wing and overcharged on the chicken cheesesteaks that their own sign and menus priced at $5.00 each. We were charged for the bleu cheese, celery and fries - which was fine even though it's something that I think the server should mention and didn't. We explained to John we just wanted to get the bill fixed so we could pay and get out because we had lots to do with our daughters that night. Ten minutes later he showed up at our table and handed us the adjusted bill. He did not offer to comp anything or discount anything even though we spent 1 hour and 40 minutes there for simple wings and cheesesteaks with one other table being served when we ordered! It really annoyed me that he left the bill at our table and did not take the credit card that we placed right in front of him to run it through. He instead I suppose went to get our server. She did not appear so I went in the back serving station and found John. I had to tell him again we just wanted to pay the bill so we could leave.We will NEVER return here. Servers are not trained to know what is on their menu - not even the specific nightly specials. They over charged us for EVERYTHING. Service was exceptionally slow. Food took forever and was fair to average at best. The management did nothing to compensate for the experience and made it worse by not running our check through after we had waited way too long to pay them and leave.This was the second time we tried The Brick House. The first time the food was just average but service was better. The first time the kids ordered the Fried Oreo dessert - it sounded good but it was so disgusting they would not eat it - it tasted of burnt oil.

I know there's a tradition of Italian restaurants in South Philly being cash only, and Gennaro's is cash only, but it's still annoying. Nevertheless, we walked the several blocks to the CVS to get cash, and came back to the restaurant.Then, we saw the menu (http://media.philly.com/documents/Grace+and+Pat+Menu+In+house.pdf). Soda is $2.50 (no refills), and extra pizza toppings are $3 each (half or whole pie is the same price). Seriously? Not offering refills on a $2.50 soda is so ridiculous and inhospitable, and I've never seen a restaurant charge $3.00 for a topping like mushrooms or red onions. We were still being optimistic, however. If the pizza was as good as Gennaro's, it would be worth putting up with some hassle and nickle-and-diming. Unfortunately, the pizza was NOTHING like what we had experienced at Gennaro's. The crust wasn't crisp, it was actually tough. We both joked that we were going to need dental work after eating it. Not only was it tough, it tasted like it had been frozen. They also used the bare minimum of sauce and cheese on the pizza (the photo on their Facebook page looks nothing like the pizza that arrived at our table). I got the white pizza, and it was like a flat bread that someone had barely sprinkled cheese on, toasted, and then forgot in the toaster oven until it got tough. My boyfriend got the red pizza and the sauce was cold in some places, and it was also topped with very little cheese. Same tough, frozen-tasting crust. Grace and Pat's gets 1 star for the appearance of the restaurant, and the very nice waitstaff. The restaurant is really cute, the music is at a nice volume, and the waitstaff are very pleasant and attentive. If they brought over the recipes from Gennaro's this place would get 5 stars, even if they stayed cash only and were stingy with soda refills. If they stay the course with their current menu, this restaurant won't last a year.

Seemed like BS to me honestly if your looking around, fidgeting with other things and not directly talking to the person eye to eye with truth.. seemed to have fix one problem and created another... also got a call and now I can't hear ANYTHING from the phone without it being on speaker, I won't be going back here.\"", "perturbation_type": "typo", "expected_outcome": "same_as_task"}

My wife and I both ordered hot pots with broth option B, hot and spicy, with pork as the protein selection. We also ordered several add ons. The food was great, as was the service. The second time was a terrible experience. We ordered the same exact thing as the previous time. However, a few bites into our meal and we got a funny sensation in our mouth. We instantly realized what had happened. We ordered broth option B, but instead they had given us broth option A, which is the spicy Szechuan pepper broth. If you are unfamiliar with Szechuan pepper, it creates a numbing and tingling sensation in the mouth. I compare it to having lidocaine dumped into your mouth. Some people like it, but I absolutely hate it, which is why I never order it. I specifically ordered Broth B, and even pointed to it on the menu when our order was taken. After realizing that someone had screwed up the order, I asked the waitress who took our order whether or not our broth was the option B broth, or the A spicy Szechuan. She said it was spicy Szechuan. I told her that I had ordered B. She then went to the kitchen, came back, and told me that the broth was not Spicy Szechuan like she had initially said, but rather it was the hot and spicy broth (option B) that I had ordered. She then told me that the kitchen had said that both option A and B had Szechuan in them. I know that wasn't the case because I ordered the exact same thing 6 days before and it definitely DID NOT have Szechuan in it. I ate that entire dinner without any Szechuan sensation in my mouth. However with this dish, I had taken 5 bites and my mouth was already tingling. After that, she left our table and never came back. She didn't refill drinks, didn't check in. Just ignored us. We had to press the service button on the table to get our check after waiting for ages. She brought the check, and of course they charged us for the wrong orders. ISo to summarize, our order was screwed up. Shortly after receiving wrong order, I addressed the issue with the waitress. Then the waitress and/or kitchen lied about the screw up.

My wife managed to eat about 1/3 of hers, but it just wasn't the same for her as the last time.

The second time was a terrible experience. We ordered the same exact thing as the previous time. However, a few bites into our meal and we got a funny sensation in our mouth. We instantly realized what had happened. We ordered broth option B, but instead they had given us broth option A, which is the spicy Szechuan pepper broth. If you are unfamiliar with Szechuan pepper, it creates a numbing and tingling sensation in the mouth. I compare it to having lidocaine dumped into your mouth. Some people like it, but I absolutely hate it, which is why I never order it. I specifically ordered Broth B, and even pointed to it on the menu when our order was taken. After realizing that someone had screwed up the order, I asked the waitress who took our order whether or not our broth was the option B broth, or the A spicy Szechuan. She said it was spicy Szechuan. I told her that I had ordered B. She then went to the kitchen, came back, and told me that the broth was not Spicy Szechuan like she had initially said, but rather it was the hot and spicy broth (option B) that I had ordered. She then told me that the kitchen had said that both option A and B had Szechuan in them. I know that wasn't the case because I ordered the exact same thing 6 days before and it definitely DID NOT have Szechuan in it. I ate that entire dinner without any Szechuan sensation in my mouth. However with this dish, I had taken 5 bites and my mouth was already tingling. After that, she left our table and never came back. She didn't refill drinks, didn't check in. Just ignored us. We had to press the service button on the table to get our check after waiting for ages. She brought the check, and of course they charged us for the wrong orders. ISo to summarize, our order was screwed up. Shortly after receiving wrong order, I addressed the issue with the waitress. Then the waitress and/or kitchen lied about the screw up. Then we were ignored for the rest of the time. Finally, we ended up being charged for the wrong order, which I didn't even eat. My wife managed to eat about 1/3 of hers, but it just wasn't the same for her as the last time. It is not only bad practice to give someone a product they didn't order, lie about it, and then charge them for it, it is also unethical. This place does not operate an ethical establishment. If you decide to order here, MAKE SURE THEY GET YOUR ORDER RIGHT from the start. Go over it several times, because if they screw it up, they will lie and leave you hanging.\"", "variant_query": "Draft a professional reply to this 1-star review for Uniboil: \"My first dining experience at this place was very good.

After the fact, I thought of several things I could have said to him. Yesterday, two older men walked in and stood next to the table where I was sitting.

vehicle out for a quick test drive,we come back go into the salesmans office and he asked for my driver's licence,trade-in vehicle registration and he starts checking numbers on the vehicle then he suggests we take the vehicle home until monday so we reluctantly agree.So Sunday rolls around and we decide to take the vehicle back,we get there and I asked a manager if he could locate my keys for my vehicle that I left at the dealership so they could appraise my trade-in which they couldnt even be bothered to lock after I had left it there thinking it would be safe(stupid to have assumed they would have cared about customers vehicles i guess) the \"Manager\" tells me he is not a magician and he cannot locate my keys I will have to call my salesman to which he says with his Cell Phone in his hand \"do you have a cell on you if so i'll give you his number you can call him yourself\",so I call the salesman to which he says \"well you werent supposed to bring the vehicle back until tomorrow I have your keys,drivers licence and registration in my briefcase at home with me and I live 35 minutes away so can you come back tomorrow\" So I agree to come back tomorrow and give the salesman the benefit of the doubt.So Monday arrives The family is on our way back to the dealership,so we arrive I go in ask for our salesman 5 minutes goes by I ask for him again another 5 minutes goes by I ask again then the receptionist calls another Manager so he can go around and see if he can find the salesman to tell him his 5 O'clock APPOINTMENT is here,Lo and Behold the salesman has gone home for the night and he has taken all of my personal belongings home with him again,so with this salesman knowing my family and I were going out there for an APPOINTMENT he couldn't even be bothered to pick up the phone and say he wasn't available that day,so the other manager asks if we could come back tomorrow which would have made 3 days in a row of trying to get MY personal belongings back.Needless to say a third day was not happening,I arranged with the Manager to have the salesman drive my vehicle to my wife's work whenever he decided to show up to work again.So when

\"well is it Ok if i mail it to you\".Needless to say when he comes back the second time with still no apology he says to my wife \"well i guess we are even now since I have been here twice and you have been to the dealership twice\",then he continues to tell my wife when he went back to the dealership he worked out another deal on another vehicle, heres the numbers if you want to take a look.So

Well, actually, after the first experience all I really hoped was that they could at least provide a clean meal. I really wasn't asking for anything exceptional and somehow the second experience was worse than the first. The first time I visited BACON was for brunch with my husband. I ordered the classic buscuits and sausage gravy. While the meal did taste good while eating it, my stomach did not have a good rest of the day. I walked out feeling bloated and gross. Even worse? 9 hours later I was still burping and tasting the gravy I had eaten that morning. Way too greasy. Storytime! The second time I visited BACON I actually chose it and asked my friend to meet me there. Biggest mistake ever that left my friend sick to her stomach and I embarrassed and disgusted. After making our way through the super crowded ordering booth (which, by the way, is the stupidest set up ever), we sat at the only table available even though it was covered in the last attendee's meal. It wasn't until we were delivered our food the waitress noticed how grody the table was and cleaned it up AFTER setting our food down on it. Yes, I expected her to take it back, come back with a clean cloth, wipe the table and re-serve is our food, when I'm paying $12 for an omlette and fruit. The nightmare didn't stop there...My wonderful friend and I ordered vegetable omelettes. with a side of fruit. It tasted great until a couple bites in and my friend noticed something funky in her omlette. It turned out to be a freaking thick piece of hair. It looked very pube-like. Disgusted, we called over a waitress and asked for a new one which she did promptly. She got a second, freshly made omlette in about 5 minutes. I was hoping things would be smooth sailing from here but NOPE. After two, I repeat, TWO, freaking bites my friend made a face and stuck her tongue out, reaveling ANOTHER hair. This one was different. It was super long, definitely from someone's head. We both gagged and I pushed my omlette away. Hell no did I believe I was eating a clean plate when both of my friend's had hairs. I was so pissed at this point I got up and stormed to the stupid ordering booth and demanded a refund. To make up for the disaster the manager did gift me a $15 gift card that I probably won't be using. One hair is something I can get past if fixed but TWO?! Don't you guys have any kind of quality assurance or sanitary protocols?! Do your chefs wear hair nets?! Note also, the hairs weren't on the surface on the omlette, they were embedded within them, meaning they were cooked after the hairs made their way into the food. I should have grabbed pictures of the hairs but after the second one I was so disgusted the only thing on my mind was getting my refund and dipping out. I won't be using that $15 gift card, I'd rather pay for clean food than eat free, unsanitary, disgusting hairy food. Sorry If this review is so long but I had to get everything in. BACON, you guys showcase your business as a high-class, modern eatery. That, coupled with your high prices, means you should be delivering exceptional customer service and quality meals.

Shame, shame on you.\"", "variant_query": "Draft a professional reply to this 1-star review for BACON: \"By now I've given BACON two chances to wow me. Well, actually, after the first experience all I really hoped was that they could at least provide a clean meal. I really wasn't asking for anything exceptional and somehow the second experience was worse than the first. The first time I visited BACON was for brunch with my husband. I ordered the classic buscuits and sausage gravy. While the meal did taste good while eating it, my stomach did not have a good rest of the day. I walked out feeling bloated and gross. Even worse? 9 hours later I was still burping and tasting the gravy I had eaten that morning. Way too greasy. Storytime! The second time I visited BACON I actually chose it and asked my friend to meet me there. Biggest mistake ever that left my friend sick to her stomach and I embarrassed and disgusted. After making our way through the super crowded ordering booth (which, by the way, is the stupidest set up ever), we sat at the only table available even though it was covered in the last attendee's meal. It wasn't until we were delivered our food the waitress noticed how grody the table was and cleaned it up AFTER setting our food down on it. Yes, I expected her to take it back, come back with a clean cloth, wipe the table and re-serve is our food, when I'm paying $12 for an omlette and fruit. The nightmare didn't stop there...My wonderful friend and I ordered vegetable omelettes. with a side of fruit. It tasted great until a couple bites in and my friend noticed something funky in her omlette. It turned out to be a freaking thick piece of hair. It looked very pube-like. Disgusted, we called over a waitress and asked for a new one which she did promptly. She got a second, freshly made omlette in about 5 minutes. I was hoping things would be smooth sailing from here but NOPE. After two, I repeat, TWO, freaking bites my friend made a face and stuck her tongue out, reaveling ANOTHER hair. This one was different. It was super long, definitely from someone's head. We both gagged and I pushed my omlette away. Hell no did I believe I was eating a clean plate when both of my friend's had hairs. I was so pissed at this point I got up and stormed to the stupid ordering booth and demanded a refund. To make up for the disaster the manager did gift me a $15 gift card that I probably won't be using. One hair is something I can get past if fixed but TWO?! Don't you guys have any kind of quality assurance or sanitary protocols?! Do your chefs wear hair nets?! Note also, the hairs weren't on the surface on the omlette, they were embedded within them, meaning they were cooked after the hairs made their way into the food. I should have grabbed pictures of the hairs but after the second one I was so disgusted the only thing on my mind was getting my refund and dipping out. I won't be using that $15 gift card, I'd rather pay for clean food than eat free, unsanitary, disgusting hairy food. Sorry If this review is so long but I had to get everything in.

Julie Vanderbrook, the church's director was absolutely awful to work with. When booking this church know that if you are not a parishioner you will \"need to find your own priest.\" Ok, understandable. They do many weddings and the priest would never catch a break, but being an out of town bride I asked Ms. Vanderbrook if she had a list of priests in the area that may be able to officiate our ceremony. Her response was \"No, I guess you'll have to find someone who lives here to help you out.\" The night of the rehearsal I arrived 10 minutes late, yes I understand that was rude, but she told my mother \"oh well, we are starting without her!\" It was a stressful time with many moving parts and I apologized. She ran through the rehearsal one time and expected everyone to get it. We were out of there in 20 minutes. No one really knew what they were supposed to do. She didn't explain herself well and we all felt very rushed.The day of the wedding she was an absolute nightmare. Our wedding started at 7:00 and guests who arrived at 6:55 were told, by Ms. Vanderbrook, \"You are late!\". My husband wanted to escort his sister down the aisle and at 6:40 she started rushing him telling him to go go go, finally he had to look at her and say, no one is even here yet, I'm not walking her down.
