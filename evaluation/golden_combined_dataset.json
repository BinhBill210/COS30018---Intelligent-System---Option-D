        "We switched from AT&T to Verizon recently and we were promised free credits, free accessories, etc. to compensate for activation fees.

The turnover seems to be a problem too since the person who helped set up our account is no longer there. Managers do not return calls. Overall, a terrible experience with this store. I gotta say that Verizon customer service has been excellent to deal with, but still unable to resolve my issue. Not surprised to see so many one-star ratings for this store. | As far as Verizon Wireless stores go, this is better than most. That I've given it two stars isn't saying much about other Verizon stores. I've always had better luck at Circuity City. Inside, the store is very nicely laid out, brightly lit, and well organized. As well, it's well staffed.I've been to this store twice, and both were horrible experiences. The first was to buy Blackberry devices for myself and my wife, about a year and a half ago. A simple transfer took almost three hours for no apparent reason. They've got one person working the transfer desk, with a line of people waiting for their new phones, and ten employees walking around the sales floor, effectively doing nothing, since the only customers in there had already purchased phones and were waiting for them. A good manager would have cross-trained their employees and moved sales people to the support desk to help transfer people to their new phones. Even with the long wait, the manager never did so, just stood around and talked with his sales people.The second time I was at the store, I'd gone because my Blackberry stopped working. The tech looked inside the phone and said that the indicator had gone off, indicating that the phone had gotten wet. I told him that it had never been near water, and what's more, it had never even been in a humid bathroom with a shower running. He told me I had to go through my insurance, rather than giving me a new phone, and I asked to speak to the manager. While speaking to the manager, she was unwilling to budge on the insurance claim, and wouldn't even give me the benefit of the doubt, given my 12+ year history with Verizon, and the fact that in the seven years I'd had equipment coverage, this was my first claim.These two experiences have made me never want to walk into another Verizon store again. Do yourself a favor and head to the Best Buy Mobile store in Moorestown Mall."

As well, it's well staffed.I've been to this store twice, and both were horrible experiences. The first was to buy Blackberry devices for myself and my wife, about a year and a half ago. A simple transfer took almost three hours for no apparent reason. They've got one person working the transfer desk, with a line of people waiting for their new phones, and ten employees walking around the sales floor, effectively doing nothing, since the only customers in there had already purchased phones and were waiting for them. A good manager would have cross-trained their employees and moved sales people to the support desk to help transfer people to their new phones. Even with the long wait, the manager never did so, just stood around and talked with his sales people.The second time I was at the store, I'd gone because my Blackberry stopped working. The tech looked inside the phone and said that the indicator had gone off, indicating that the phone had gotten wet. I told him that it had never been near water, and what's more, it had never even been in a humid bathroom with a shower running. He told me I had to go through my insurance, rather than giving me a new phone, and I asked to speak to the manager. While speaking to the manager, she was unwilling to budge on the insurance claim, and wouldn't even give me the benefit of the doubt, given my 12+ year history with Verizon, and the fact that in the seven years I'd had equipment coverage, this was my first claim.These two experiences have made me never want to walk into another Verizon store again. Do yourself a favor and head to the Best Buy Mobile store in Moorestown Mall."

        "We switched from AT&T to Verizon recently and we were promised free credits, free accessories, etc. to compensate for activation fees. Two months later, I am still dealing with a first bill of over $400. It has been impossible to get an answer regarding the credits they promised. The turnover seems to be a problem too since the person who helped set up our account is no longer there. Managers do not return calls. Overall, a terrible experience with this store. I gotta say that Verizon customer service has been excellent to deal with, but still unable to resolve my issue.

Our server was friendly and came to take our drinks. We told her we were ready to order dinner. Two of us ordered wings and two of us ordered Chicken Cheesesteaks. She looked at us like we were from outer space. Robot where's Will kinda outer space. She said she didn't think they had chicken cheesesteaks on their menu. We opened up the menus she had given us a few minutes earlier and showed her the Monday night chicken cheesesteak special. She asked if we wanted bleu cheese and celery with wings - yes. She asked if we wanted fries with the cheesesteaks - yes. She didn't mention the extra charge for this.There was exactly one other table - another family of four in the restaurant and only two people at the bar when we placed our order. It took 27 minutes for us to get two orders of wings and two chicken cheesesteaks. That seems like a long time to me.Wings were fine no complaints. My 8 year old who has a pretty well developed palette said the chicken was really dry. My husband agreed. We figured they used left over pre-cooked chicken from the weekend, diced it up and put melted cheese from a can on it. We were finished with our dinner and had to wait about 20 minutes more until our server came by. We asked for the check and a box for my left over wings. Ten minutes later she came back with the bill - no box but she would go get one. Our total bill was $55 plus tax. It should have been $32 plus tax. We tried to explain to her (another 5 minutes of this) why the bill was incorrect. She then said she would fix it.Ten minutes later - she came back and gave us the new bill. This time it was $52.My husband tried briefly to explain it again but I suggested we bring over a manager to get it resolved.More waiting and then John, the manager came by. We explained to him why the bill was incorrect. They overcharged me for my glass of wine, charged $1.13 per wing that should have been .39 cents per wing and overcharged on the chicken cheesesteaks that their own sign and menus priced at $5.00 each. We were charged for the bleu cheese, celery and fries - which was fine even though it's something that I think the server should mention and didn't. We explained to John we just wanted to get the bill fixed so we could pay and get out because we had lots to do with our daughters that night. Ten minutes later he showed up at our table and handed us the adjusted bill. He did not offer to comp anything or discount anything even though we spent 1 hour and 40 minutes there for simple wings and cheesesteaks with one other table being served when we ordered! It really annoyed me that he left the bill at our table and did not take the credit card that we placed right in front of him to run it through. He instead I suppose went to get our server. She did not appear so I went in the back serving station and found John. I had to tell him again we just wanted to pay the bill so we could leave.We will NEVER return here. Servers are not trained to know what is on their menu - not even the specific nightly specials. They over charged us for EVERYTHING. Service was exceptionally slow. Food took forever and was fair to average at best. The management did nothing to compensate for the experience and made it worse by not running our check through after we had waited way too long to pay them and leave.This was the second time we tried The Brick House. The first time the food was just average but service was better. The first time the kids ordered the Fried Oreo dessert - it sounded good but it was so disgusting they would not eat it - it tasted of burnt oil. So disappointed because I love the old bank building but the experience was truly awful.\"",

        "We bought our sofa and love seat here recently! I looked at over 10 furniture stores, and Urban Styles had the best discounts and great quality furniture! Mike and Jeff were both a big help! I definitely plan on buying my next set of couches here. | I had an amazing experience at Urban Styles. I always love popping in to see what new stuff they have because they offer such an eclectic mix...not your typical boring furniture store. Billy was my salesperson and did an amazing job answering all of my questions, but never being too pushy or sales-y. He was quick in getting my order taken care of and had lots of knowledge about the different sofas and the care plan (which I saw the value in and purchased). I opted to pick up my sofa since their warehouse is really close to my house and it was seamless and the guys at the warehouse were very fast in loading onto the truck for me. I will definitely be coming back when I need another piece and will be heading straight to Billy. Thank you!!"

        "Are these reviews for real? The service was so nice there, but the food is so gross. Other people I was eating with actually used the term gross. The clam chowder was so obviously canned, the side salad looked like one you could get from Wendy's, and the fish tacos were terrible. I got the peel and eat shrimp, but the shrimp were not cleaned properly and had some kind of mysterious gunk on them (steamed--really??). Seriously avoid. No really--don't even think about it. | In the good old days, the Fourth Street Shrimp Store served delicious food at reasonable prices. I'm sorry to say that I think it's slipping. Example: entrees used to be served with breadsticks. Those were replaced by day-old hamburger buns soaking in butter and garlic powder. One server told me that it was a cost-cutting measure. I personally pleaded with the manager to bring back the breadsticks, and he said that other customers had told him that they can get breadsticks at the Olive Garden, so he's doing something different. I'm sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, that's a lame excuse for saving a few pennies. Although I'll come back here, it's not as good as it used to be, and the prices are skyrocketing. NOTE: I probably should have given this restaurant two stars, but I added a star for old time's sake."

        "Are these reviews for real? The service was so nice there, but the food is so gross. Other people I was eating with actually used the term gross. The clam chowder was so obviously canned, the side salad looked like one you could get from Wendy's, and the fish tacos were terrible. I got the peel and eat shrimp, but the shrimp were not cleaned properly and had some kind of mysterious gunk on them (steamed--really??). Seriously avoid. No really--don't even think about it. | In the good old days, the Fourth Street Shrimp Store served delicious food at reasonable prices. I'm sorry to say that I think it's slipping. Example: entrees used to be served with breadsticks. Those were replaced by day-old hamburger buns soaking in butter and garlic powder. One server told me that it was a cost-cutting measure. I personally pleaded with the manager to bring back the breadsticks, and he said that other customers had told him that they can get breadsticks at the Olive Garden, so he's doing something different. I'm sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, that's a lame excuse for saving a few pennies. Although I'll come back here, it's not as good as it used to be, and the prices are skyrocketing. NOTE: I probably should have given this restaurant two stars, but I added a star for old time's sake."

We thought this was a bad sign, but decided to stay, because we had loved the pizza at their other location (Gennaro's Tomato Pie), and had been wanting to try Grace & Pat's since it opened.The first annoyance was that it was cash only, with no ATM on site. I know there's a tradition of Italian restaurants in South Philly being cash only, and Gennaro's is cash only, but it's still annoying. Nevertheless, we walked the several blocks to the CVS to get cash, and came back to the restaurant.Then, we saw the menu (http://media.philly.com/documents/Grace+and+Pat+Menu+In+house.pdf). Soda is $2.50 (no refills), and extra pizza toppings are $3 each (half or whole pie is the same price). Seriously? Not offering refills on a $2.50 soda is so ridiculous and inhospitable, and I've never seen a restaurant charge $3.00 for a topping like mushrooms or red onions. We were still being optimistic, however. If the pizza was as good as Gennaro's, it would be worth putting up with some hassle and nickle-and-diming. Unfortunately, the pizza was NOTHING like what we had experienced at Gennaro's. The crust wasn't crisp, it was actually tough. We both joked that we were going to need dental work after eating it. Not only was it tough, it tasted like it had been frozen. They also used the bare minimum of sauce and cheese on the pizza (the photo on their Facebook page looks nothing like the pizza that arrived at our table). I got the white pizza, and it was like a flat bread that someone had barely sprinkled cheese on, toasted, and then forgot in the toaster oven until it got tough. My boyfriend got the red pizza and the sauce was cold in some places, and it was also topped with very little cheese. Same tough, frozen-tasting crust. Grace and Pat's gets 1 star for the appearance of the restaurant, and the very nice waitstaff. The restaurant is really cute, the music is at a nice volume, and the waitstaff are very pleasant and attentive. If they brought over the recipes from Gennaro's this place would get 5 stars, even if they stayed cash only and were stingy with soda refills. If they stay the course with their current menu, this restaurant won't last a year. East Passyunk has too many great, reasonably-priced restaurants, and too much great pizza for anyone to want to make a return visit to Grace & Pat's. I really, really hope the owners take their Yelp reviews to heart, and address the problems with the current menu.\"",

My boyfriend got the red pizza and the sauce was cold in some places, and it was also topped with very little cheese. Same tough, frozen-tasting crust. Grace and Pat's gets 1 star for the appearance of the restaurant, and the very nice waitstaff. The restaurant is really cute, the music is at a nice volume, and the waitstaff are very pleasant and attentive. If they brought over the recipes from Gennaro's this place would get 5 stars, even if they stayed cash only and were stingy with soda refills. If they stay the course with their current menu, this restaurant won't last a year. East Passyunk has too many great, reasonably-priced restaurants, and too much great pizza for anyone to want to make a return visit to Grace & Pat's. I really, really hope the owners take their Yelp reviews to heart, and address the problems with the current menu.\"",

        "I am so not a runner... but I did walk the CCC this year as a charity walker and my team raised money for Team Gleason (http://www.teamgleason.org/). The charity arm of the CCC is great. There were 15 possible charities to work with and a ton of money was raised. So yay!The race start was a little confusing to a novice like me. I knew you were supposed to be in your bib color start but late arrivers tried to run people over and get ahead of you. I mostly tried to keep out of the way and not get stepped on... There were fun bands/snacks/water along the way. And it was fun to see who costumed and who was in their serious running gear. For the record, my bunny ears were fine. My bunny leggings didn't breathe so well on that muggy day.The after party (to which you can purchase tickets) was fun but very muddy at the City Park festival grounds. We hung out for a bit and then wandered over to where we had left a 2nd car the night before. There were buses to take you back to start but the lines were long. Great run that goes through a good swath of the city. | This road race starts with 5 stars. I mean, running from the French Quarter to Mid City along some legendary streets and experiencing the unique sights, sounds and smells of the City with about 20,000 fellow runners is amazing in itself. The huge after party at City Park does this City, which is known for its parties, proud. So Kelly, you may ask, why are you only giving this event 3 stars? Well, on the very slim chance that an organizer of this event actually reads this I hope they take it for what it is - constructive criticism. For the record, I am a seasoned runner with many 10Ks under my belt so I do know a little about these. On to my issues...1. Overall course management leaves much to be desired. While many of these types of open runs are \"Organized chaos\" this one is simply chaotic. There should be more effort put into keeping groups (by groups I am referring to runners, joggers, walkers, etc) together instead of a mishmash of all types of participants. I would suggest more categories - (they seem to have this worked out well for the 40 minute and under finishers) but for those of us in 50 - 60 min categories, well, why not give us our own categories and actually enforce it? 2. Slow Joggers, Walkers, and Mommy Types pushing strollers along the route - PLEASE note a couple of things about race courtesy. Please don't walk more than two abreast. Please allow the runners to start ahead of you. Please be aware that runners will pass you and its considered bad behavior to call anyone passing you an \"asshole\". 3. Hydration stations - very poor organization. When you are running (or even walking) 6.2 miles in 80 plus degree weather hydration is very important. Efficient, clean, properly staffed hydration stations are important. Also I will note the sanitary conditions of at least one of the stations. Empty cups were lined up on a table. Water was emptied into a large garbage can. Race participants needing water had to take a cup and dip it into the garbage can of water to get a drink. Not healthy, folks. Not healthy. Sorry for the rant folks. Just wanted to make a point."

        "I want to like this place...I really do. This is a Walmart Neighborhood Market, not a Walmart. They've got food, house stuff, and a pharmacy. Don't go here expecting to get oil, or windshield wipers, or a hammer.The folks in this location are a unique bunch...think entitled UT kids and folks who wear neon vests during the day and hold cardboard signs. There are also a few shell shocked South Tampa folks sprinkled in.This used to be a Save-A-Lot and this is certainly an improvement from that, but not much. They do offer a Liquor Store that looks like it might be the cleanest place to buy booze in Tampa. I didn't go in, but I'm sure the prices are great.For some unknown reason this place closes it's self checkout lines at around 8.

The miso soup tasted like hot water with the littlest bit if miso paste in it. The fried rice was all soy sauce and pepper. Really salty. I wished we had ordered white rice like the kids. My husband and I had steak and the chef never asked how we wanted it cooked, it ended up over cooked and chewy. And way too much pepper. The kids' chicken was ok, but again over peppered and it was a struggle to get them to eat it because of all the \"black stuff\". Finally, the server was less than attentive and overall the service was slow. The floors were sticky, the place had an overall greasy feel to it. We will never be back here.

        "I visited Nigh with some colleagues after work, with the intent of only drinking beers on the patio. There were 5 people in our party, but Nigh is limiting parties on the patio to 4 people per table. Begrudgingly, we sat inside but this would not have been our preference during the pandemic. The interior looks great compared to the previous brewery. Much brighter and more modern, but with many TVs present, so it gives a sports pub vibe, which is a little confusing. The staff kept seating tables around us, and the tables were not 6' apart from one another, so that was concerning. Staff was inconsistent with how they wore their masks (some off the nose, some pulled down around their chin, some covering nose and mouth), so COVID safety procedures are very loosely followed here. As for the beer, what I tried was just okay. One IPA I had was very malty with little hop character and was the same color as the ESB that someone else at my table ordered. We didn't try any of the food, but what I saw on other tables looked good. Our server was extremely friendly and efficient. I would come back, but only if I can sit outside, at least until everything concerning the virus calms down. | Great place to kick back, enjoy a cold beer & good food! So much better than the former Black Swan, Nigh is bright & open. Not brewing at this location yet, but the 16 taps feature local & Indiana craft beer. There's a full bar with an emphasis on good bourbon. Inside & outside dining."

        "This was going to be where i popped my city library cherry. Alas, I didn't even get to first base during that inaugural visit.I had arrived on a weekday morning, only to find out that this branch didn't open until noon. Granted, I should have checked the website for hours, but it just didn't occur to me that a library would be closed at 11 a.m. Thus, I ran a quick errand, returned to wait in the parking lot, and then ventured inside at noon.The entrance from the parking lot is daunting. The automatic door is nice, but you walk into a weird vestibule without adequate signage telling you that pretty much everything is upstairs.At the information desk upstairs, I tried to get a library card, but they denied me because my driver license still has my previous address. It was within the city, but they still wanted a bill with my current address on it. I explained that all my bills were online and asked if i could show one via my phone, but they declined and demanded mail with my address on it. Any mail. That seems easy to fake, but whatever. I left and ended up getting my library card at a different branch. I returned a week later because the Jefferson branch was close to an appointment. New card in hand, I took a seat in one of the upstairs rooms to the right at a round table and tried to find an outlet for my laptop. A girl (not a worker) pointed out that outlets were hidden under bookshelves along the wall, not at the tables like in other branches. Moreover, there weren't many outlets, so if you couldn't sit next to one or didn't have an extra long cord for your laptop, you were out of luck.Wifi is free and speed is ok, just like at most of the other city library branches. You're not confined to a specific wifi seating area, either. I haven't wandered around much here. I know that there are a few computers with internet near the info desk (you need a library card to use them). The book selection looked decently fresh. Eh. *shrug*This library really is just my backup for when my preferred branches are inconvenient on certain days. | The library itself is a bit small but the staff is extremely kind and helpful. As a parent, it brings my heart joy when the staff takes the time to share a smile and have a conversation with my child. While Buder is our neighborhood library, we make the drive for the friendly staff."

        "Great little place in the middle of nowhere. They have about 10 tables and there is a parade of people picking up take-out pizza, but it really didn't detract from enjoying my meal. With their internet coupon, dinner was less than $30. Really enjoyed my shrimp and scallop pasta. Four nice size shrimp and 4 scallops on a mountain of pasta with a rosa sauce. Companion had a chicken and pasta dish. Both were great. I had the salad and he had the soup. Nice that they offer a choice. Bread was good, too. Waitress confirmed it was Conshohocken. Only complaint was we both had a little agita, but that's to be expected with the richness of the sauces. Oh, and the pasta was a perfect al dente. | this is our local go to place. I have to say it is really good. Johnny is a great guy who loves what he does and can really cook! I have eaten my way through the entire menu (at least the saute dishes and some specials). It really is all that! You cannot go wrong with his seafood, pastas, chicken, etc! I like his Pizza (I do not think Pizza should be put in a box, eat it where it is made if at all possible!). Excellent Calzones, fruta De Mar, Arrabiatta, Etc. It is a hidden Gem and our \"secret\" place to go. And it is BYO!"

He calls the other store in Reno to see if they can do it. They couldn't, and magically he pulls out a black screen from the back and he tells me he can do it if I come at 3. So I came a few minutes beforehand. I needed my cracked iPhone 6s Plus screen fixed. My home button, both cameras (front and back) worked perfectly fine beforehand. I take it in, the guy fixes my screen but now both cameras don't work and he's telling me that he can fix them for an additional 80$. Seemed like BS to me honestly if your looking around, fidgeting with other things and not directly talking to the person eye to eye with truth.. seemed to have fix one problem and created another... also got a call and now I can't hear ANYTHING from the phone without it being on speaker, I won't be going back here.\"",

Okay it's not trending & could use some updates, but, if it isn't broken, don't fix it.It is really fairly large with a juke box & darts in the front bar & pool tables in the back.I have no complaints on drinks or their prices. They also have a nice bar menu. I tried the hot dog, it was nothing special. The nachos had good flavored meat & I was able to get real cheese.Yesterday I got their wings & they were fabulous! Not really big, but fried hard with a crackling outside & I got the sweeter sauce, which was perfectly sweet & Spicey. Very sticky & very good. I am sure I will work my way through the menu, as it all sounds great. They even make their pizzas in house, no frozen pies here, I have seen them, but yet to order one.What's a girl to do? Good atmosphere, friendly people & staff, good cheap drinks & homemade food, sounds good to me! | I enjoy the atmosphere and happy they are open! Great pool tables and food. A good place to relax and be yourself."

        "This is truly a hidden gem! It la located off 19, just South of Hwy. 54, in a dilapidated old strip mall. I passed it hundreds of times & just thought it was another beer & pool dive. Was I mistaken!It is really quite large inside, has a full bar, plenty of friendly folks & the owners stay present & are nice people I am quite sure, I found my neighborhood \"CHEERS\".Depending on my mood & other factors, decides what I am drinking, so I can never be one that gets their regular. Okay it's not trending & could use some updates, but, if it isn't broken, don't fix it.It is really fairly large with a juke box & darts in the front bar & pool tables in the back.I have no complaints on drinks or their prices. They also have a nice bar menu. I tried the hot dog, it was nothing special. The nachos had good flavored meat & I was able to get real cheese.Yesterday I got their wings & they were fabulous! Not really big, but fried hard with a crackling outside & I got the sweeter sauce, which was perfectly sweet & Spicey. Very sticky & very good. I am sure I will work my way through the menu, as it all sounds great. They even make their pizzas in house, no frozen pies here, I have seen them, but yet to order one.What's a girl to do? Good atmosphere, friendly people & staff, good cheap drinks & homemade food, sounds good to me! | I enjoy the atmosphere and happy they are open! Great pool tables and food. A good place to relax and be yourself."

Chicken gnocchi is the best soup if in the mood for a cream soup. Salad was great. The breadsticks were cold but otherwise fine. Server was excellent. Brought back refills very quickly!New menu is interesting. Check it out! | Food was typical. Service was not so great. Started out ordering and sampling Reisling...she brought Moscato. 5 of our party of 6 ordered, waitress distracted and didn't take the final order until appetizers arrived. Salad took forever to come out. Entrees took even longer still with the 2 unlimited soup orders coming out a few minutes later. Needless too say, mo seconds on soup as ot was time to go. Not a good experience. Probably won't be back...at least not this location!!"

        "I was lucky enough to get a gift-card for TinWings as a wedding present, and it's helped so much! Not having to cook some weeks is a huge weight off my shoulders.And as another poster mentioned, their pricing is higher than what you'll find at a typical take-away store, but for good reason - the food is delicious and the ingredients are very high-quality. These ladies also put twists on recipes that you wouldn't expect, but without sacrificing quality. Simple and tasty! And the women who own the store do most of the cooking, shopping, and baking themselves.If you're looking for basic take-away food, head somewhere else, because this place is definitely a step above! | I'm appreciative this place does not sacrifice quality ingredients in their food at he sake of trying to get prices down. I personally can tell the difference from processed or frozen foods vs. fresh, quality foods. My husband picked up two meals the other night at $40 and we have gotten 6 servings out of it. Not bad I think for a delish Home cooked meal and perfect for on the way home when I don't feel like cooking! The tamales were out of this world and the shrimp gumbo had plenty of fresh large shrimp.... Some of the best shrimp I've had in a while!!! We will absolutely be returning!!!"

        "For the most part, I might actually wait until they move out to their Neshaminy Mall location. Usually, I don't like making advance appointments since I like to stay flexible and I rarely have trouble coming in as a walk-in client. Well, to my surprise, I walked in on Saturday, September 30th and they told me they were fully booked (even for a simple haircut) and that the next opportunity for walk-in service wouldn't be until sometime until October 7th when I was expecting to be out of town. Since I was in desperate need for a cut, I decided they didn't need my business that day. Besides, previous service here has been pretty much hit or miss depending on the student doing my haircut. I understand my thick and constantly growing hair can be a challenge to some, but I can't be as bad as the next person. Le sigh...your mileage may vary, and it's been a while since I found a steady stylist who truly understands the needs for my hair cut experience. | The issue with this place is that it is hit or miss... Unfortunately for me, today was a miss!! From the start I felt that the student that was going to do my hair was inexperienced and not sure about anything. From the way the parted my hair for the coloring I should have known that this was not going to end well. Long story short, I left with a much darker hair that what we (the student, the instructor and myself) had agreed upon. I had a trim that was joke because the student was unable to do it herself so she called the instructor that \"did it\" in 2 minutes. I stayed there for 3 hours and not once was offered water. By the end I had such a headache I just wanted to get out of there. The instructors were not helpful at all by recognizing that the color was indeed not what I wanted, but not offering absolutely any solution.

        "Short version- easy, quick, clean walk-in clinic where you actually see a DOCTOR not an NP. I received good care here and would recommend. This was my first time coming to PUC clinic and I had a great experience. Everyone at the front desk very nice and friendly. Their waiting room was very cozy, well decorated, clean and classy. I'd suddenly developed back pain which progressively worsened throughout the day. It was a Friday evening and not many other places (aside from the ER) were open so I anticipated having to wait a decent amount of time. This was not the case and I was pleasantly surprised to be called back within about 10 minutes of filling out all the new patient paperwork. The doctor was nice and knowledgable which made me feel comfortable. The whole visit from check in to check out took less than an hour! Next time I need urgent care I will definitely come back to physicians urgent care. | These guys are amazing! This is owned by 5 former ER physicians and one of them is always on site. Their customer service is right on target and they are very thorough with their assessment. We use them all the time and will continue to do so over our PCP. If you like the customer service at chick-fill-a or public, you'll love this place."

        "Short version- easy, quick, clean walk-in clinic where you actually see a DOCTOR not an NP. I received good care here and would recommend. This was my first time coming to PUC clinic and I had a great experience. Everyone at the front desk very nice and friendly. Their waiting room was very cozy, well decorated, clean and classy. I'd suddenly developed back pain which progressively worsened throughout the day. It was a Friday evening and not many other places (aside from the ER) were open so I anticipated having to wait a decent amount of time. This was not the case and I was pleasantly surprised to be called back within about 10 minutes of filling out all the new patient paperwork. The doctor was nice and knowledgable which made me feel comfortable. The whole visit from check in to check out took less than an hour! Next time I need urgent care I will definitely come back to physicians urgent care. | These guys are amazing! This is owned by 5 former ER physicians and one of them is always on site. Their customer service is right on target and they are very thorough with their assessment. We use them all the time and will continue to do so over our PCP. If you like the customer service at chick-fill-a or public, you'll love this place."

A different happy hour each night which makes the week that much more exciting!(You can smoke here so be warned and don't get pissy when somoene lights up next to you)Plus, their prices are conducive to repeat business! I can drink all night AND still have money left over for a 2am taco! So I suggest you add this place to your local week visitation schedule! | Used to come here while on business to the city. Dive bars are hip. Not this one. This one is just a mess. Bugs, I mean COCKROACHES, crawl along the bar and into people's coats (I overheard). I have seen the roaches and had a few crawl onto my hand. In the men's bathroom there's just a trash bag taped on the wall where a urinal used to be. I have also overheard that 3 female employees have quit. Which makes it seem like it's not a safe place for ladies. The bartender I encountered seemed very overwhelmed and perturbed with serving customers that weren't friends and that weren't doing shots of cheap liquor. Bartender was also playing obnoxious hip hop too loud and denied access to the jukebox that clearly was just paused, not \"broken\", like he poorly tried to explain.

        "I got my first facial at Peaches last week and I am so happy with the results of just one facial! I have struggled with acne my whole life and have tried every product and treatment you can imagine. My biggest issue now is the scaring that results from my years acne and with just one facial and one week use of their products, I notice less redness and my face is so much smoother. I have been able to go all week with little to no makeup! Nicole was incredible....sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about skin, especially while focusing on my specific skin concerns. I found the facial at Peaches to be even more relaxing then numerous ones that I have had in the past and the salon is beautiful and extremely clean. I just moved to LA, however I am so satisfied with my results so far that I'll continue to drive up to see Nicole for the amazing service and work! | I had my very first facial this weekend! I got a recommendation from a good friend of a great little privately owned spot in town. She also sent me a killer first timers deal:) After reading about the salon and really REALLY loving the website and info I had found, I made an appointment.I arrived a little early on Saturday AM to make sure I had time to fill out any paper work. When I arrived I fell in LOVE with the ambiance.

        "I got my first facial at Peaches last week and I am so happy with the results of just one facial! I have struggled with acne my whole life and have tried every product and treatment you can imagine. My biggest issue now is the scaring that results from my years acne and with just one facial and one week use of their products, I notice less redness and my face is so much smoother. I have been able to go all week with little to no makeup! Nicole was incredible....sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about skin, especially while focusing on my specific skin concerns. I found the facial at Peaches to be even more relaxing then numerous ones that I have had in the past and the salon is beautiful and extremely clean. I just moved to LA, however I am so satisfied with my results so far that I'll continue to drive up to see Nicole for the amazing service and work! | I had my very first facial this weekend! I got a recommendation from a good friend of a great little privately owned spot in town. She also sent me a killer first timers deal:) After reading about the salon and really REALLY loving the website and info I had found, I made an appointment.I arrived a little early on Saturday AM to make sure I had time to fill out any paper work.

        "My \"modern\" apartment is in a building that is 100+ years old, which is fine, but don't expect anything modern from it. The I won't review the apartment, but rather the company itself... so they have this 24 hr maintenance line... which is basically a call service. You leave a message like, \"hey, i got a gas leak\" (this really happened to me), and they say, \"sure, ill pass this on to them\"... you call an hour, two, three later...\"still got that gas leak\"... \"sorry sir, i left a message on their machine\"... eventually i called PGW, who finally fixed everything at 5 freaking am. Also had an upstairs neighbor who was out for the day leak on my apartment during the weekend... basically there was a flood from the ceiling, the whole day i was changing buckets, until he finally got home. I was leaving messages, emailing the WPRG owner (who was actually responding, but not sending anybody to help until the next monday morning). Finally got resolved when the neighbor got home and found half of his apartment destroyed (of course WPRG is not responsible for your personal belongings). And finally, this is what is happening to me now: a year ago they've sent me a letter that rent is being raised two months ahead of the cycle dictated by the contract. Somehow I let that slip by and paid higher rent for two months when I wasn't supposed to... now they are using that against me to say that my contract terminates two months earlier (june instead of august, which is whats written on paper). In summary, they will try to scam you given any opportunity, but as far as the apartment itself, it was fairly good for the price and location. The company itself is the problem! | If you want something done by this company, your going to call an answering machine. There is no email address or a paper trail of any kind which is highly convenient for the company. Expect to call several times. Expect to be hung up on when you explain your case. Expect the lease agreement to have the wrong address. Expect your apartment to be infested with roaches and mice upon move in. And dont bet on your apartment being ready when you move in either. Expect the central air to just blow air. And expect the negative attitudes to trickle down to the people who come by to fix your things too. After a few verbal altercations with the \"boss\", the little people who come by to actually do the work will turn nasty on you too. Its a very negative environment and living here is pretty miserable overall. I will say the apartment is very attractive otherwise and all the new kitchen is pretty awesome which is what sparked our attention. But dont expect service of any kind. They like to just keep their heads above legal waters and as long as they stay there, theres really nothing you can do but wait for the lease to expire and move out."

They don't check their voicemails, ever.They don't have anyone answering their front desk, 99% of the time.

I have been trying to get in touch with a human being (NOT voicemail) at your office for over three weeks regarding an insurance/billing problem. I have left multiple daily, voicemails with Lori in Billing and with Steve. None of these calls have gone answered. I can't believe how unresponsive your office is. If you check your voicemails or email, you have my contact details. PLEASE HAVE SOMEONE CONTACT ME, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I will be leaving similar messages on every social media site I can find."

        "These guys are the best. Everyone on staff is knowledgeable and friendly and miles above those chain places where everyone is doing the same exercises. They constantly evaluate, re-evaluate, and adjust, and always make sure that you're doing things the right way for maximum effect and minimum pain. My daughter's back pain from scoliosis improved in a matter of days, and as her goals for therapy change, the approach changes to accommodate it. As with any therapy regimen, it won't work if you don't, but if you're willing to commit to the exercises, the results will inevitably follow. You're in good hands here.Speaking of hands, as a former massage therapist, it's very difficult to find a MT who measures up to my expectations.

        "The Lantern Theater company has been around since 1996 and is actually housed inside the St. Stephen's Theater at 10th and Ludlow. The space also gets rented out as a multi-purpose performance space so you may see other theater groups perform here from time to time. Check their website for the production schedule.From their website it says they've been nominated for many awards and have won quite a few too in just over a decade of existence. And from the quality of their performance, they probably deserved every one.Recently I went to see \"School for Wives\" by Moliere. It was excellent. The cast was magnificent and gave wonderful performances. They hit the style of Moliere right on the head with this show. The set and costuming were both well done. There is not much that I can say except that this being my first Lantern production it definitely made a positive impact and I will return to see another.The theater space itself if very interesting. It actually has two seating areas that form a right angle with the stage as the meeting point of the two sections. In addition, there is a proscenium arch against one of the back walls. Although, depending on the show, the space is used in many different ways.Lighting instruments are exposed from the grid above the stage and the stage is level with the first row of seats in each section. Some times the actors may even interact with the front rows. (For example, in the performance I went to, a patron got up and returned from the bathroom just as one of the actors came around the corner of the stage. The actor briefly danced with him (in character).)Seating is general admission and you will have to climb two flights of stairs to get up to the theater. The auditorium has two sections of raked seating. The sight lines are excellent no matter where you sit. The space is highly intimate with just over 100 seats.One draw back: Expect a line for the men's room. It's in the basement and there is only one stall and one urinal. It was like role reversal with the ladies room. | I had a great experience with this theater last week when visiting Philadelphia. I ordered a ticket easily online the night before and was able to walk there in 10 minutes from my hotel.It's a small theater but all seats have a good view of the stage. The best part was the play. The acting was phenomenal and I laughed all night."

These products are awesome and I know he and mom will love them.I also grabbed 2 Old World Italian hoagies. I've had these before and they are very good and well worth the $12.26 each for a 12\" hoagie. Today was different, I really don't know if they made the correct hoagie, there was no mortadella meat or roasted peppers on it and not much proscitto on it, but I was very disappointed. Probably more of really disappointed as my expectation was very high as I remember bragging before to my Dad and family how good these hoagies were before when I bought them and recommended they check the place out.I can say, it's hard to find a really good Italian hoagie, not the BS you get at Wawa or other deli's, but one with great Italian meats - you know what I'm talking about if u had one before. I hope this was just one bad experience and will probably try them again when in the area. I will say, there pasta 's are all excellent.\"",

        "The Tresor Gallery is très cool! This is what I was envisioning when I think of what kind of art would embody New Orleans. Their pieces are edgy, dark, whimsical, and eccentric. The gallery features art from Tim Burton, a hyper-realistic larger-than-life sculpture of Lincoln by Kazuhiro Tsuji, Molly Maguire's circus banners popularized by American Horror Story, Brandon Maldonado's calaveras, and other countless other incredible artists! This is the place to go for your art fix! | I love these guys! There is no pressure when you walk in the door, and they are knowledgeable about the artist they feature in their gallery, excellent customer service! When I think of New Orleans, I think of the creepy darker side of history this city represents. Tresor Gallery has pieces that reflect those views and convey what I'm looking for in my artwork. This gallery is edgy and twisted, it's perfect! The place always draws me in, even when I promise myself I won't buy anything, but I always end up walking out with something I love.. There is no other gallery in New Orleans like Tresor."

        "The Tresor Gallery is très cool! This is what I was envisioning when I think of what kind of art would embody New Orleans. Their pieces are edgy, dark, whimsical, and eccentric. The gallery features art from Tim Burton, a hyper-realistic larger-than-life sculpture of Lincoln by Kazuhiro Tsuji, Molly Maguire's circus banners popularized by American Horror Story, Brandon Maldonado's calaveras, and other countless other incredible artists! This is the place to go for your art fix! | I love these guys! There is no pressure when you walk in the door, and they are knowledgeable about the artist they feature in their gallery, excellent customer service! When I think of New Orleans, I think of the creepy darker side of history this city represents. Tresor Gallery has pieces that reflect those views and convey what I'm looking for in my artwork. This gallery is edgy and twisted, it's perfect! The place always draws me in, even when I promise myself I won't buy anything, but I always end up walking out with something I love.. There is no other gallery in New Orleans like Tresor."

I made an appointment and went back the next week to get the work done, and he did a fantastic job. The price was quite reasonable, as well. My tattoo is beautiful.

If the software doesn't work shut it down please! It's also the second time the rude hosts said it must be us and sometimes that just happens! I've been going to first watch using Nowait and yelp for years and never had an issue at any other locations other than Clearwater. I'm about to give up on first watch because even after this happened the hosts didn't seat us as we were the only people waiting to be seated two others walk in after 5-10 minutes and they were about to just seat them until my girlfriend spoke up and then they suddenly said oh sorry yes right this way. While sitting there we counted 5 tables open and clean and 3 more open waiting to be bussed. This is nothing less than poor management and staff. Oldsmar first watch is off our list too many other choices that honestly are better and cheaper.\"",

        "First off this place does not accommodate a large party. All chairs are benches or attached to the table so we had to split the party up which was very inconvenient since my family from out of town was visiting. This place is also somewhat on the more expensive side. We spent $60 easily. The staff seemed bothered and would leave you waiting at the counter for a while. The food is okay. The chicken is salty and the rice didn't blow my mind or anything. The only thing that was actually really good was the refried beans. Wouldn't come here again unless I really had to. | Very good food! Seriously, the chicken was excellent and their tortillas are to die for. I had the individual chicken meal number one. I would definitely recommend and will definitely go back"

I ordered the carne asada quesadilla, two crispy chicken tacos and the cheesecake. The crispy chicken tacos were pretty tasty and the price is right at 2.50 each, if you want it with guac and sour cream, expect to pay 4.50 each. Two bucks extra just for guac and sour cream. The quesadilla was just okay, it was a little chewy and not very crispy and the carne asada was pretty forgettable, with no spicing or flavor whatsoever. Their salsa also was pretty much just tomato juice, no real spicy flavor whatsoever, as well as another red sauce they gave me that looked okay but again just had no flavor. In regards to the Cheesecake, it should have just been called a whip cream cake. There is no way it's a cheesecake at all. All in all, pretty disappointing but if you don't really care about quality, and don't want to do any add-ons, 2.50 is about as cheap as you can get, but there's no way I'll eat here again...\"",

If you are a non zoo member this will cost you $10 a person. This was my first time going to see the lights. I absolutely loved it. Each area of the zoo has a different theme of what the lights are. For example, in the Arctic area they are white and blue lights with light up animals. They do have some animals that you can see during the walk but not a lot. So if you are expecting to see lights and all the animals this event is not for you.

The first and best thing about this zoo is that it has free admission. Even though there is some street parking for free the majority of parking is paid at $10.00. My family and I went on a hot, summer afternoon. There is not a lot of shade so be prepared with a hat and sunglasses. There are limited exhibits in this zoo. The most popular exhibit at the zoo was the polar bear. I felt the space was really small for an animal of this size. Most of the animals were sleeping or standing or just looking dazed. This included the apes, gazelles, zebra, camels and even the turtles. The giraffe were in a barn type area inside where they had to duck there heads to fit. I really did not like this at all so after that exhibit we left. I would not go here again unless there was nothing else to do.\"",

        "We have normally taken our dog to PetSmart for grooming but decided to try Hottie Hounds since it was much closer to our home. I emailed them, asking how they would handle our dog who can be a bit anxious. They responded quickly and set him up with an appointment time when it was quiet in the salon. I felt at ease with their responses and how they were so accommodating to make sure he had a great first visit. The salon is clean and the staff are so friendly! I knew my dog was in good hands. The price was affordable when compared to what we normally paid at PetSmart but included much more! His package included a trim, nail grinding and brushing his teeth. They're always running specials too. Plus it was quick service! It took an hour when compared to the past we usually had to wait over 3-4 hours to get him back. Our dog did wonderful and the staff were so great to him. Definitely taking my dog back here! Highly recommend this for your dog's grooming needs! | Just took my 5 puos there and I will be back. They are rescues and one is not so nice. Lol. They all looked so beautiful. The grooming girls where very friendly with me and my dogs. Theres more than one groomer and they worked quickly I dropped them off at 10 and they where done by 1. The price was very reasonable. Thank you. We will be seeing you soon. I have a before and after check out how cute they look!!"

        "Lanna Thai is quaint but authentic. The decor is lacking but not because they're not trying. They do the best with what they have. I actually came here when they first opened late last year but wanted to go again before writing a review.I ordered the Khao Soi soup and I was very impressed. The flavor was great and there was a lot of chicken. I should say that I was in a rush and when I told the owner she definitely accommodated me. I came in at the same time as a couple and when the owner came to great us she asked if it was for 3 and we all laughed and said no. Once she realized we were separate there was an awkward moment when she asked if I was waiting for others and I said it was just me. The reason I'm taking away a star is because of the bathroom. There was a really weird smell and it felt damp. I was going to play soccer afterwards so I had to change into my gear and it was not a pleasant experience (not that changing in any public bathroom is pleasant).All in all I would definitely come back to Lanna but make sure I don't need to visit the facilities. | We decided to visit Lanna Thai Cuisine based on the other reviews and we were not disappointed. This is the best Thai food that I have found in Edmonton. The coconut rice was excellent and the green curry had just the right spice. The only thing that worried me was we were the only people in the restaurant at 6pm on a Saturday. More people need to come and try their delicious food or this wonderful restaurant may disappear. The family who runs it is as nice as can be and needs the community to support them. Will be back!"

        "Lanna Thai is quaint but authentic. The decor is lacking but not because they're not trying. They do the best with what they have. I actually came here when they first opened late last year but wanted to go again before writing a review.I ordered the Khao Soi soup and I was very impressed. The flavor was great and there was a lot of chicken. I should say that I was in a rush and when I told the owner she definitely accommodated me. I came in at the same time as a couple and when the owner came to great us she asked if it was for 3 and we all laughed and said no. Once she realized we were separate there was an awkward moment when she asked if I was waiting for others and I said it was just me. The reason I'm taking away a star is because of the bathroom. There was a really weird smell and it felt damp. I was going to play soccer afterwards so I had to change into my gear and it was not a pleasant experience (not that changing in any public bathroom is pleasant).All in all I would definitely come back to Lanna but make sure I don't need to visit the facilities. | We decided to visit Lanna Thai Cuisine based on the other reviews and we were not disappointed. This is the best Thai food that I have found in Edmonton. The coconut rice was excellent and the green curry had just the right spice. The only thing that worried me was we were the only people in the restaurant at 6pm on a Saturday. More people need to come and try their delicious food or this wonderful restaurant may disappear. The family who runs it is as nice as can be and needs the community to support them. Will be back!"

We were given an in-depth explanation of everything, and there was quite a lot you need to know, but in truth it was very simple.My family brought their dog, and the restaurant allowed us to become the very first to sit outside - they even took pictures for their wall!-Since we were outside, they cooked the meat beforehand, though I believe if you sit inside then the meat is cooked in your soup!-Overall, we had a great experience, and considering the restaurant opened only a month before we went there, I'd say that this is definitely an important gem to try in our community here in Goleta! | The greatest hot pot store in SB! Today I ordered one to go but they might be to busy and gave me a wrong one. However, when I called their store, the manager delivered to me the right one because I don't have a car.

My wife and I both ordered hot pots with broth option B, hot and spicy, with pork as the protein selection. We also ordered several add ons. The food was great, as was the service. The second time was a terrible experience. We ordered the same exact thing as the previous time. However, a few bites into our meal and we got a funny sensation in our mouth. We instantly realized what had happened. We ordered broth option B, but instead they had given us broth option A, which is the spicy Szechuan pepper broth. If you are unfamiliar with Szechuan pepper, it creates a numbing and tingling sensation in the mouth. I compare it to having lidocaine dumped into your mouth. Some people like it, but I absolutely hate it, which is why I never order it. I specifically ordered Broth B, and even pointed to it on the menu when our order was taken. After realizing that someone had screwed up the order, I asked the waitress who took our order whether or not our broth was the option B broth, or the A spicy Szechuan. She said it was spicy Szechuan. I told her that I had ordered B. She then went to the kitchen, came back, and told me that the broth was not Spicy Szechuan like she had initially said, but rather it was the hot and spicy broth (option B) that I had ordered. She then told me that the kitchen had said that both option A and B had Szechuan in them. I know that wasn't the case because I ordered the exact same thing 6 days before and it definitely DID NOT have Szechuan in it. I ate that entire dinner without any Szechuan sensation in my mouth. However with this dish, I had taken 5 bites and my mouth was already tingling. After that, she left our table and never came back. She didn't refill drinks, didn't check in. Just ignored us. We had to press the service button on the table to get our check after waiting for ages. She brought the check, and of course they charged us for the wrong orders. ISo to summarize, our order was screwed up. Shortly after receiving wrong order, I addressed the issue with the waitress. Then the waitress and/or kitchen lied about the screw up. Then we were ignored for the rest of the time. Finally, we ended up being charged for the wrong order, which I didn't even eat. My wife managed to eat about 1/3 of hers, but it just wasn't the same for her as the last time. It is not only bad practice to give someone a product they didn't order, lie about it, and then charge them for it, it is also unethical. This place does not operate an ethical establishment. If you decide to order here, MAKE SURE THEY GET YOUR ORDER RIGHT from the start. Go over it several times, because if they screw it up, they will lie and leave you hanging.\"",

        "Hidden little gem. When I am looking to buy cigars this is my go to place. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Always have exactly what I am looking for. | Nicest and largest selection in the NorthEast, perhaps in the entire city.

        "The old Arbys has been transformed. It is now Chinese selling combo meals from as little as $5.99 to no more than $8.95. Cheap eats in sufficient quantity for a meal. No MSG. Free delivery in a limited area for a $10 minimum.The owners claim this is not just another Panda Express or \"Americanized Chinese Food,\" but on my visit, it looked like standard Americanized Chinese food: Moo Goo Gai Pan; Orange Chicken; Sesame Pork; Mongolian Beef or Chicken; Fried Rice; Won Ton Soup; Egg Rolls and about 20 other predictable Americanized dishes. But if you stop and think, would we really eat authentic Chinese Food? Think, chicken heads and feet, fungus, dogs and cats. Yum yum! If you sold authentic Chinese food in the US, you'd be broke in a New York second. The only dishes that seemed that they might be authentic were the Keyone and Yazzyon Soups. I searched the net and no one has a record of such a soups, so they probably aren't Authentic Chinese. The \"Y\" soups are a pricy $7.50 per bowl.After tasting several of the dishes, this place earned only one star. The Mongolian Beef was horrible and a dish that I could not eat: spongy texture to the meat, and sickly sweet instead of spicy as promised. Two of the chicken dishes had better texture, but still too sweet and really lacking in flavor. The egg rolls were soggy, white steamed rice ok, shrimp fried rice was passible but bland. Too bad, no Brown Rice. Of six meals consumed, no one gave a rating better than two. I'm still a bit intrigued by the Y Soups, but afraid I'd be wasting my time and my money and still walk away hungry as I did when I left my Mongolian Beef. All in all, this is the second worst Asian food I've ever eaten.I'd rather have Panda Express any day. Or the Arbys it used to be. And I'm not a big fan of either. | I got F'd in the drive thru.. I'm sure the food is great, but instead of a great Chinese chicken salad I got home with a big bowl of dry veggies & chicken. lolThey forgot the dressing.. :("

Every time I've been there, there have been groups of older men sitting and chatting and inevitably, one or more of them will say something derogatory to me. For example, several months ago, as a group of self-identified Christian men were ending their meeting, one of them approached me and asked, \"Aren't you afraid to be a single woman in a room full of men?\" I was concentrating on my work, so I didn't feel the need to engage him in conversation. After the fact, I thought of several things I could have said to him. Yesterday, two older men walked in and stood next to the table where I was sitting. While looking at me, one of them said to the other, \"Doesn't she know that's your table? She must have ignored the reservation sign.\" They stood there for a moment, looking at me, before walking to another table. After they walked away, I packed up my things and left, and I won't be back. There are plenty of other coffee shops around where I can spend my money and not have to deal with unwanted negativity from other patrons.\"",

        "I recently purchased my first vehicle from Sherwood Dodge and being that it was my first venture into car buying for myself, it was a great experience. I had made sure to bring my own backup considering I know very little about vehicles. I dealt with Byron and never once did I feel pushed into anything or like I was being taken advantage of. I had shopped around a little bit before buying and almost all of the other salesmen I dealt with were pushy or condescending. I got a great deal and wouldn't hesitate to shop there in the future. | Stay away!Shysters. Tell you everything you want to hear, of course personable and friendly, cause it's their job. they really don't care about the person. They make the buying part a decent experience, until after the fact of course. Once they have your money they do not give a shit about you. They had supposedly done an inspection on the vehicle we bought before selling it to us, but of course we found issues almost right away. Trying to get them to fix these items was the worst experience. And they were items that should've been caught in the inspection, like a broken seatbelt. Had to make numerous trips back to the dealer for these repairs and they weren't apologetic at all for the hassles. Didn't offer to reimburse gas for all the trips. Now we're finding out certain crucial info about the cars history that was not disclosed fully to us in the beginning. That info would've caused us not to buy the vehicle, but they knew that and weren't upfront. They made the info vague and now we're finding out the vehicle isn't worth nearly as much as we thought and doubt we'll be able to resell if we wanted to.Worst car buying experience ever. They have caused us so much stress. Don't let their personable charm fool you. These are car sales men. They're pros at being fake.Do not buy from them.These guys don't even deserve one star."

        "Great food for a good price . Small inside , but I didn't have to wait anytime for my food . Plus you get a GREAT amount for little money . This is definitely going to be my go to Asian food place !!! | I have ordered sushi for delivery a few times and it was good, so I decided to stop in with my kids for lunch. It took a long time to get drinks because they had to make more tea. I ordered fried won tons, thinking it was the plain, fried, chip-like won tons. When my kids discovered there was meat inside they did not want to eat it. When the waitress came to clear plates, she asked if something was wrong with the won tons. I told her that they didn't care for the meat. The waitress proceeded to tell me that her boss was going to be mad because we didn't eat the food! Really??? As we sat and waited for our sushi, I couldn't help but notice how dirty the place was. We were seated by the window and the blinds and window had what looked like splattered food stuck to them. The chairs and table was sticky and the floor had food pieces and crumbs all over. It not like it's a huge area to clean! When the dining area is unkept, it makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like."

        "Great food for a good price . Small inside , but I didn't have to wait anytime for my food . Plus you get a GREAT amount for little money . This is definitely going to be my go to Asian food place !!! | I have ordered sushi for delivery a few times and it was good, so I decided to stop in with my kids for lunch. It took a long time to get drinks because they had to make more tea. I ordered fried won tons, thinking it was the plain, fried, chip-like won tons. When my kids discovered there was meat inside they did not want to eat it. When the waitress came to clear plates, she asked if something was wrong with the won tons. I told her that they didn't care for the meat. The waitress proceeded to tell me that her boss was going to be mad because we didn't eat the food! Really??? As we sat and waited for our sushi, I couldn't help but notice how dirty the place was. We were seated by the window and the blinds and window had what looked like splattered food stuck to them. The chairs and table was sticky and the floor had food pieces and crumbs all over. It not like it's a huge area to clean! When the dining area is unkept, it makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like."

        "My boyfriend purchased a necklace and earrings from here for my birthday. It wasn't super expensive but it cost enough to have been better quality...and also receive better service. When I got it I immediately noticed a kink in the chain. I went in to the store to exchange it or have it fixed. It was only 2 or 3 days after the original purchase. The sales lady exchanged it. While waiting I browsed around and had to pretty much interrupt two sales people who saw me and were chatting and blocking the jewelry cases. After leaving with a new necklace, I wore it two times and the chain broke. This was all within a month after purchase and only wearing the necklace twice. Again I went back in to the store. They took my necklace to be repaired. When I went back to pick up the repaired necklace, I again noticed a small kink in the chain. The sales lady proceeds to tell me that I didn't purchase an insurance plan (or whatever they call it there) so I would have to pay for any further repairs. I was confused on why I would need to purchase insurance to repair something that had been poor quality from the beginning. I barely touched the jewelry so why would that be my responsibility. I took the necklace and left and will never return. I also made sure to point out to my boyfriend that if he ever plans on making a significant jewelry purchase, (between the quality and customer service) he should not visit this store. The sales people were never rude but they weren't professional either. It's also apparent that there isn't a dress code for employees."

        "I was very excited to have a weekday off from work to dine here for the first time as Berryhill restaurants are Idaho institutions. However, the experience at Bacon didn't match my hopes. I don't think it's a constant, judging by other's reviews, but our particular food outing did not meet expectation.Pro's: We ordered the bacon shots appetizer, which was the best part of our meal. We did enjoy being able to have a sampler of the bacon specialties. My husband enjoyed the maple rosemary, I enjoyed the kurobata.Con's: I ordered cheese grits and a side of fruit. The cheese grits had all of the shredded cheese on top and it wasn't melted or interspersed in the grits. In fact, the shredded cheese was cold on the hot grits.My husband had the biscuits and gravy, the sausage gravy itself was excellent. However, the biscuit they served, they had cut in half and hid the burnt bottom of the biscuit. Also, the self-serve coffee was cold.I know that it is our responsibility as dining patrons to let the restaurant know if something is amiss, however, with so many problems, it just didn't feel worth it.Conclusion: I can see the vision and inspiration they are trying to achieve with this restaurant. However, the execution was lacking. | Bacon reminds me of almost every trendy restaurant in LA. The concept and atmosphere is suppose to distract you from the average trying too hard food. I had the French toast which was yummy and my fiancé had the breakfast burrito which he did enjoy. I liked their candied bacon the flavor was really nice. But if you are going to name your place bacon I feel there should be some typical regular bacon too. Would come here again though and staff was nice. The restaurant itself is pretty. I just wanted to like it more than I did."

        "I was very excited to have a weekday off from work to dine here for the first time as Berryhill restaurants are Idaho institutions. However, the experience at Bacon didn't match my hopes. I don't think it's a constant, judging by other's reviews, but our particular food outing did not meet expectation.Pro's: We ordered the bacon shots appetizer, which was the best part of our meal. We did enjoy being able to have a sampler of the bacon specialties. My husband enjoyed the maple rosemary, I enjoyed the kurobata.Con's: I ordered cheese grits and a side of fruit. The cheese grits had all of the shredded cheese on top and it wasn't melted or interspersed in the grits. In fact, the shredded cheese was cold on the hot grits.My husband had the biscuits and gravy, the sausage gravy itself was excellent. However, the biscuit they served, they had cut in half and hid the burnt bottom of the biscuit. Also, the self-serve coffee was cold.I know that it is our responsibility as dining patrons to let the restaurant know if something is amiss, however, with so many problems, it just didn't feel worth it.Conclusion: I can see the vision and inspiration they are trying to achieve with this restaurant. However, the execution was lacking. | Bacon reminds me of almost every trendy restaurant in LA. The concept and atmosphere is suppose to distract you from the average trying too hard food. I had the French toast which was yummy and my fiancé had the breakfast burrito which he did enjoy. I liked their candied bacon the flavor was really nice. But if you are going to name your place bacon I feel there should be some typical regular bacon too. Would come here again though and staff was nice. The restaurant itself is pretty. I just wanted to like it more than I did."

Well, actually, after the first experience all I really hoped was that they could at least provide a clean meal. I really wasn't asking for anything exceptional and somehow the second experience was worse than the first. The first time I visited BACON was for brunch with my husband. I ordered the classic buscuits and sausage gravy. While the meal did taste good while eating it, my stomach did not have a good rest of the day. I walked out feeling bloated and gross. Even worse? 9 hours later I was still burping and tasting the gravy I had eaten that morning. Way too greasy. Storytime! The second time I visited BACON I actually chose it and asked my friend to meet me there. Biggest mistake ever that left my friend sick to her stomach and I embarrassed and disgusted. After making our way through the super crowded ordering booth (which, by the way, is the stupidest set up ever), we sat at the only table available even though it was covered in the last attendee's meal. It wasn't until we were delivered our food the waitress noticed how grody the table was and cleaned it up AFTER setting our food down on it. Yes, I expected her to take it back, come back with a clean cloth, wipe the table and re-serve is our food, when I'm paying $12 for an omlette and fruit. The nightmare didn't stop there...My wonderful friend and I ordered vegetable omelettes. with a side of fruit. It tasted great until a couple bites in and my friend noticed something funky in her omlette. It turned out to be a freaking thick piece of hair. It looked very pube-like. Disgusted, we called over a waitress and asked for a new one which she did promptly. She got a second, freshly made omlette in about 5 minutes. I was hoping things would be smooth sailing from here but NOPE. After two, I repeat, TWO, freaking bites my friend made a face and stuck her tongue out, reaveling ANOTHER hair. This one was different. It was super long, definitely from someone's head. We both gagged and I pushed my omlette away. Hell no did I believe I was eating a clean plate when both of my friend's had hairs. I was so pissed at this point I got up and stormed to the stupid ordering booth and demanded a refund. To make up for the disaster the manager did gift me a $15 gift card that I probably won't be using. One hair is something I can get past if fixed but TWO?! Don't you guys have any kind of quality assurance or sanitary protocols?! Do your chefs wear hair nets?! Note also, the hairs weren't on the surface on the omlette, they were embedded within them, meaning they were cooked after the hairs made their way into the food. I should have grabbed pictures of the hairs but after the second one I was so disgusted the only thing on my mind was getting my refund and dipping out. I won't be using that $15 gift card, I'd rather pay for clean food than eat free, unsanitary, disgusting hairy food. Sorry If this review is so long but I had to get everything in. BACON, you guys showcase your business as a high-class, modern eatery. That, coupled with your high prices, means you should be delivering exceptional customer service and quality meals. I am so embarrassed I brought a great friend here only to be disgusted. Shame on you. Shame, shame on you.\"",

        "Do not give this store your business. I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance to try on wedding dresses. My godmother drove in from 2 hours away, my mother took off work early and one of my bridesmaids rearranged her schedule to attend the dress shopping session. When we arrived to the store they had a handmade sign on a scrap of paper saying they closed at 3:30 (scratched out) 2:30 p.m. that day. I could see two ladies through the window in the store so I knocked, thinking well maybe they closed to walk-ins but I had an appointment so surely they were expecting me. One of the women started to walk towards the door pointing to the sign saying they were closed. I said, \"but I have an appointment.\" She shook her head no and pointed to the sign. This went on for about a minute before she finally cracked the door open and said, \"we're closed.\" I repeated, \"but I have an appointment.\" And she tells me, \"No you don't.\" Which blew me away. I know I made the appointment I had a 10 minute conversation with the woman on the phone when I made the appointment. I reassure her I have an appointment and she once again tells me \"No you don't. Are you sure you actually made an appointment.\" The woman just kept repeating we're closed there is no one here to help you. And telling me I didn't have an appointment. She made zero efforts to resolve the situation. She didn't offer to reschedule my appointment or even invite us in to discuss options. She had a very bad attitude and was super unfriendly. She was very rude and clearly didn't care to have our business. Save yourself the trouble and visit a store that cares about their customers. | I have to second everything said by Rachel S. I bought a deb gown here several years ago and the service then was very frigid. They only seem to perk up once you agree to buy a dress which I think is ridiculous. Now I'm getting married and although I no longer live in NO, I called in while I was in town visiting family to see if they had a dress I was interested in trying on. They were extremely rude to me on the phone and instructed me to send them an email with the exact style #. I asked for the email address and she said \"well it's the same as the online website - www.townandcountrybridal.com\" When I pointed out that that was a web address and NOT an email address, she rudely put me hold and got someone else who was not an idiot to tell me the email address. Ultimately, I decided not to bother even going in there since I was confident I would find a dress that I love close to where I live in San Francisco (where the service was much better).I think this place has some really beautiful gowns and I think it's worth a stop in if you live in New Orleans which has relatively few bridal salons (I'd also stop by Wedding Belles and Mimi Vera Wang which were great). The service at T & C has got to improve though. Being totally snobby to potential customers is mean and is really just an antiquated approach to selling high end retail."

When I arrived in the store, it was not particularly busy, but there were a couple of customers in there. They told us that someone would be right with us, but to look around in the meantime. Well, we waited for about 45 minutes, and still no help. At that point, my mother pulled one of the sales associates aside and explained we had been waiting for a long time after making an appointment and asked when someone might be able to help us. The bad service didn't stop there, however. When someone, Ashley, finally started \"helping\" us, she put me in a room with the gowns and left for forever. Finally after I had tried on a couple huge gowns and decided to nix them without her even clipping them, she walked in and helped me put a third on. After that, she again left me with all the clips on. About fifteen minutes later, another saleswoman came in and asked me if I was finished shopping. I informed her that Ashley had disappeared and I was stuck in the dress. Then I had to pull dresses off the rack myself and flag this second woman down to clip them. She was very very rude to me, and kept leaving me in the dressing room alone frequently. Finally, my mother had a stern chat with her, and she pretended to be nice for the last fifteen minutes. The thing is, I actually found a dress there that I really liked (no thanks to the staff!), but I decided not to buy it because the service was so terrible. It's a shame because they could have made money off of our shopping and seem to have deliberately chosen not to. It was also disappointing because shopping for a wedding dress is supposed to be a very happy time for a mother and daughter, and my experience at Town & Country put us both in a bad mood.

        "Good care if you can get in for an appointment; now running months!Once there you are at the mercy of the scheduling people and some of the support staff that is plagued with sloth and lassitude. There is little coordination between visits, no sense about continuity of treatment. If you get sent to a local treatment facility because the VA can't get you in for months it is done without ANY coordination whatsoever. In my case the next VA appointment available was 4 weeks hence, so I was referred to a local/private eye clinic only to find their wait time was 6-8weeks !Two(2) to three(3) hour waits are normal. People are nice but some are incompetent. | Dad is going on 94 and goes here for Glaucoma and Macular Degeneration, the last one requiring shots directly into the eye.Both treatments are great, if not somewhat lengthy (averaging my wait time of 3 hours or more while he's in treatment) but recently things have gotten goofy.They started setting his Glaucoma appointments the day after the MD shots, skewering the results and making it a nightmare for the old guy (cripes, he looks like he went a couple losing rounds with Ali). I asked they schedule the both on the same day with Glaucoma first and MD second.Well, they did, sort of. They cancelled the Glaucoma testing completely (yet give him the meds) and didn't bother telling him or me.And now they say either me or him have been cancelling the MD shot appointments. Really? I love driving 45 miles on interstates 4 and 75 early in the a.m. only to find the appointment cancelled.Finally, and this part is somewhat humorous, they put their facility across the street from the Medical Examiner, aka, Morgue."

        "Called this company to help me with my plumbing and the owner came to inspect my house and told me that he would give me a discount if I went on a date with him. I thought he was kidding but then he came close to my face and asked again, I had to ask him to leave my property. Lucky I didn't call the cops! I felt so disrespected! Extremely unprofessional I never had to deal with such disgust in my entire life. Please beware of this company the owner is an old nasty man that tries to bribe on woman | This is by far and away the most unprofessional company I have ever worked with - hands down. Below you'll find a rundown of just some of the issues we've experienced with them: - We were told the job would take 2-3 days. Start to finish, the job took nearly 6 weeks. For a ROOF REPLACEMENT. - We asked repeatedly for documentation/pictures of extra wood the company claimed was required however they never provided us with either but did tack on over $700 in additional fees for additional materials used. - Calls, texts, and voicemails were almost never returned. In fact, less than 25% of all attempts to reach them were returned. - Our roof sat exposed for nearly two full weeks (after the tear off) while we made REPEATED (daily calls/texts) to find out when a crew would be out to put on the shingles. - Employees and the OWNER of this company hung up on us on several different occasions. The only thing we have ever asked this company to do is honor the commitment they made to us. - When asked why no calls/texts were returned, the owner's \"partner\" yelled (\"F**k you, Lady\"). He was so full of contempt and rage that I would honestly suggest he have no direct contact with clients. Period. I won't go into further details however I will say that the additional comments he made, caused us to be concerned for our well-being. In a business where word of mouth and a company's reputation is of the utmost importance, it is shocking that these people would ignore attempts to contact them, that they would actually hurl obscenities and hang up on paying customers, and that they would consider this as an acceptable way to conduct themselves. I would suggest anyone considering hiring this group refer to the Better Business Bureau for additional information (they have an F rating), and to research Corporation Wiki which shows all of the previous businesses that they have opened and closed - check out the Better Business Bureau complaints tied to those businesses, too."

I would suggest anyone considering hiring this group refer to the Better Business Bureau for additional information (they have an F rating), and to research Corporation Wiki which shows all of the previous businesses that they have opened and closed - check out the Better Business Bureau complaints tied to those businesses, too.\"",

I complimented the manger - who displayed ZERO personality - on the cleanliness, but pointed out the toilet seat. She confirmed that a new seat was on order. - Tisk, Tisk...

        "We had a wonderful experience with this company. The owner was conscientious--he kept an eye on things, and made sure we were completely satisfied. But the workers themselves made sure they did a good job! They could not have been more clean and careful, inside and out. We had star bolts put in, which meant they had to cut holes in the living room ceiling. They hung plastic and put down drop-cloths, and since they had to work over three days, the plastic had to be taken down and then put back in place every single day, so we could use our front door. They were always cheerful, polite, and terribly pleasant. The ceiling looked as good as new when they were done. The outside work involved repointing and repairing and recoating the stucco. The job was done impeccably. Our neighbours were very impressed. So are we. We'd use them again in a heartbeat. | Bad experience with this company on two occasions, but didn't know the first experience was so bad until after the second. I'll explain. Years ago this company was hired to do extensive work on a building that was being renovated for condos. Lots of brick pointing and facade work on a building that had been vacant for many years, but was beautiful nonetheless. The bill for the work was huge, but just a few years later new residents were having lots of water problems. The roof was blamed over and over, but it was not the roof. The pointing in the rear of the building was so poorly done it was shocking. Later it was recalled that an early resident overheard a foreman (from WM Proud) on the job telling the crew to just make the first two floors look good and that no one would notice the work (or lack of work) on the upper floors looking up from the street. Turned out the whole building had to be redone, it wasn't just the back that was done poorly all of it was bad. This company was paid a fortune for this job. Before this problem was uncovered I had personally hired them to do some facade work and cleaning on a building and the consultant could not have been nicer, more helpful or accessible while I was deciding on whether or not to sign the contract. Once I signed he was gone and I was stuck with a guy who showed up when he wanted (even though it was promised that they would schedule times to perform work and show up on time). The work was started then stopped, started and then stopped. About 95% finished and then I had to beg them to come back and finish the work. I thought maybe I had just been unlucky or not much of a priority because the second job was small (although not inexpensive), but then when I discovered that the work they performed just a few years ago on the first project had to be completely redone and what had been said about only paying attention to the lower floors I felt compelled to write this review. The company has cost a lot of people a lot of money and wasted energy when it was not necessary. I will never use them again or recommend them obviously."

        "Every using your company for over 10 plus years I am disappointed in the respect for an elderly woman and her property. For a tow job driver not to get out of the car and greet the customer is uncalled for especially in the rain my mother (81) should have never have to have had come out of her car walk through a puddle to greet the tow truck driver. The tow truck driver was rude to my mother and rude to me then drove off with my car keys then complains and still the job did not complete.So what kind of employees are you hiring this is none of the guys that have ever come to my house before have ever been that rude. Previous tow truck drivers have been complete gentleman and shiver with but this guy was complete opposit on a scale of 1 to 10 or 1 to 5 stars he gets of -0. Still at 10:17 at night I'm waiting for another tow truck driver because a the previous driver's incompetence could be a gentleman. I got some stretching my hand if I'm thinking that my family is going to get an apology but that's OK if we don't it will be widely known it throughout town and more that this is happened from your company that I have praised before. I hope you doesn't treat his mother or any other elderly woman like this ever again. | They did a good job fixing my car. The only thing I didn't like is the woman at the front desk. She was rude to me and I heard her being rude to other customers on the phone. My guess is that this place has lost customers because of her and they don't even know it as she acts one way when someone who works there is within earshot and a different way when they are all in the garage and don't hear her. On the surface she appears to simply be disorganized. However, if you watch her for a while you see a pattern and she appears to be passive aggressive. Examples include: Chewing in a customer's ear on the phone, talking to a customer on the phone with a mouth full of food, accusing a customer of stealing her pen when they randomly picked up one of the six pens laying on the desk so they could sign a credit card slip. Their labor rate is $90.00 an hour."

        "Every using your company for over 10 plus years I am disappointed in the respect for an elderly woman and her property. For a tow job driver not to get out of the car and greet the customer is uncalled for especially in the rain my mother (81) should have never have to have had come out of her car walk through a puddle to greet the tow truck driver. The tow truck driver was rude to my mother and rude to me then drove off with my car keys then complains and still the job did not complete.So what kind of employees are you hiring this is none of the guys that have ever come to my house before have ever been that rude. Previous tow truck drivers have been complete gentleman and shiver with but this guy was complete opposit on a scale of 1 to 10 or 1 to 5 stars he gets of -0. Still at 10:17 at night I'm waiting for another tow truck driver because a the previous driver's incompetence could be a gentleman. I got some stretching my hand if I'm thinking that my family is going to get an apology but that's OK if we don't it will be widely known it throughout town and more that this is happened from your company that I have praised before. I hope you doesn't treat his mother or any other elderly woman like this ever again. | They did a good job fixing my car. The only thing I didn't like is the woman at the front desk. She was rude to me and I heard her being rude to other customers on the phone. My guess is that this place has lost customers because of her and they don't even know it as she acts one way when someone who works there is within earshot and a different way when they are all in the garage and don't hear her. On the surface she appears to simply be disorganized. However, if you watch her for a while you see a pattern and she appears to be passive aggressive. Examples include: Chewing in a customer's ear on the phone, talking to a customer on the phone with a mouth full of food, accusing a customer of stealing her pen when they randomly picked up one of the six pens laying on the desk so they could sign a credit card slip. Their labor rate is $90.00 an hour."

The guys were great, Robert cut my hair and did a clean job. Bill came out to $35. I'd give it a 4, but it was a little pricy for my taste, but I look human again. Don't know what you guys in Philly normally pay for a haircut. | I don't know about this place. I've had my hair cut by the somewhat young guy and the large guy (multiple times), and neither is very good. The young guy clearly didn't want to be there and rushed it, and the big guy... well, he spent about as much time running his fingers through my hair and saying \"Oh man, you got such beautiful hair man, it's amazing\" as he did actually cutting it. The big guy's haircuts always look good when I walk out, but they grow in terribly, and five days later I feel like I need haircut again.As for the vibe: it's what someone who went to state school and shaves his sideburns to a point would think is a classic high-end men's barbershop. In reality, it's catering to underemployed young guys who want to bro out and talk about breasts with a hip young barber - because that's what they think people do at high-end men's barbershops.And the price - I actually think $35 would be reasonable if they did a better job.

I lived here for almost three years, the A/C went out year one, and it took them 1 1/2 years to finally replace. I would make calls every week saying it was broken, they would only do quick band aid repairs until I made a big scene in their office. When managment finally got around to replacing the A/C, the installed one too small for our unit. Expect $300 plus electric bills during the summer, and the temp will still get into the 80's in the apartments.the water heater sparked and caught fire twice, TWICE! first time they just replaced the main board and the burnt insulation, which had nothing to do with the water leaking into the wiring. second time I caused another scene, and they finally replaced the water heater. My family could of died, my wife was so afraid that she was going to burn to death in that slum. there are light switches in the shower, I'll repeat that. Electrical switches in the shower. No insulation, old windows that won't stay open, paper thin walls, just a dump. When we moved in the staff was nice, this is no longer the case. I have noticed since moving out I'm not getting head splitting headaches anymore or nausia, so there could be the possibility of a mold problem. Avoid this place, it is a health hazard and money pit\"",

        "What previous reviewers are missing concerning Trico's deposit is that you get it back in the form of 2 months' credit back to your account after one year, which boils down to two months of a zero balance bill. This came in really handy for me and sort-of made up for the deposit. What I have really enjoyed is Trico's app: very clean and super simple to use. I never had any problem with customer service, and the one time I lost power, I received constant texts from Trico updating me on the status. I liked that. | For an internet service provider, if you have another choice-take it! I ordered a disconnect of my service today. Sometimes you have to settle for what you can get when you live beyond cable and DSL lines but when trips to use the library's wi-fi and using a 3G network on a smartphone out perform what they can deliver it's time to pull the plug.They \"guarantee\" certain minimum speed levels but dodge the issue once your own speed tests and usage prove they are less than adequate. There is a guarantee of service but no recourse, credits or compensation for repeated shortcomings.The internet is offered by Trico but run by Transworld Network. Check out their website at twncorp.com. The copyright on the website is 2009 and their billing system is so poor you can never rely on how much you owe when looking at it. When you log in it is like dealing with a website from a decade ago. This should tell you something right there. Last I heard the credit card processing through their website is just a portal for your information to be pulled and run manually. For a technology company they should be ashamed. The staff may seems \"nice\" but they will not document some calls, lie about making follow-up calls and mostly support a very poor product with a worse system. If you're just checking your social media sites and e-mail their service may be sufficient but don't expect the performance and support if you are running a business, gaming or have any other normal demands. Make another choice than this outfit. Spend a little more for less and you'll still be better off."

        "About a week ago, my dog, Amala, woke up in the middle of the night exhibiting fearful and anxious behavior. Amala was adopted in Miami approximately three years ago at roughly seven months of age, her life prior to rescue was nothing less than haunting. While living in South Florida, we had a wonderful Vet, accompanied by an equivalent Veterinary office staff who were trustworthy and made Amala feel secure. When we relocated to PA, we unfortunately had to find a new Vet.We tried a Vet closer to us in Downingtown, PA, but we weren't impressed. Amala was anxious while visiting, the Vet and staff did not seem compassionate or patient and the visits were expensive! Having a great Veterinary experience in Florida, I was determined to find the same here in PA.When Amala woke up in the middle of the night, restless, anxious and crying, I immediately assumed she was experiencing memories of her past. The next day, after our morning walk, Amala was again, anxious and crying. Although I wanted to stay home and make sure Amala was okay, Amala spends her days with Poppa (my dad), and in the event that anything should arise, Poppa would be right there to save the day!After arriving to work, I called to check in. Poppa and Amala were in Eagle/Chester Springs and Amala was crying in the background. Refusing to have Amala seen by the previous Vet in Downingtown, I searched for Vets nearby. At 9:30AM, I called LCVH and spoke with Aviva who was professional, patient and understanding. Aviva was able to schedule an appointment for 11:50AM!Vet Tech, Rachel, went over Amala's history and Dr. Harclerode performed a thorough exam. It was determined that Amala was actually in pain and she was prescribed medicine. After getting home from work, I discussed Amala's appointment with my dad. My dad reported on the compassion and care at LCVH. At 5:00PM, I called LCVH to thank Aviva for her assistance and to advise of the positive impact that was made upon my dad. Aviva put me on a brief hold and suddenly I was speaking with Dr. Harclerode for twenty plus minutes, expressing my gratitude for the hospitality in caring for Amala, regarding at-home care and regarding some missing information from Amala's prior records.Over the weekend, Amala's injury became worse. I called LCVH first thing Monday morning and spoke with Kortney who booked a follow up appt with Dr. Harclerode on Tuesday. Les than thirty minutes later, Gabriella called back to advise that there had been a cancellation and Amala could be seen later that day. At the follow up appt, Amala was greeted with much excitement from the reception staff. Vet tech, Brie, notated a brief recap of what occurred over the weekend, and advised that Dr. Harclerode would be in momentarily to see us. Dr. Harclerode suddenly had to respond to an emergency appt; however, Brie kept us apprise as to status.Dr. Harclerode again examined Amala to determine whether X-rays were necessary. Amala responded after some manipulation, and she was diagnosed with a strain of the right iliopsoas, ouch! Dr. Harclerode determined X-rays were not necessary and she prescribed Amala with a muscle relaxer to help with discomfort and provided some at-home PT exercises for recovery. Not only was I relieved that Dr. Harclerode was able to rule out a more serious injury, Dr. Harclerode did so without any added expense. In only two visits in four days' time, I am overjoyed to be able to say we have finally found a Vet AND an entire staff who exhibits the same qualities, compassion and care of the Vet and staff we grew to know and love in Florida. From initial telephone call to LCVH, to checkout at Amala's follow up appointment, I never once felt as though we were \"new\" to LCVH, or anything less than family. The cost for Amala's care and treatment, inclusive of meds, were reasonable and trivial in comparison to previous Vet that Amala had seen in Downingtown. Dr. Harclerode and LCVH staff offered exceptional care, unremarkable customer service and unsurpassed solicitude.I highly recommend Dr. Harclerode and LCVH!"

        "The Rusty's Bistro at the Sheraton (in Clearwater) is nothing to brag about. Personally, I hate restaurants where Service and the Food Quality are sub-par but prices are inflated to help elevate the perception... This is definitely one of those restaurants.My family and I had dinner at Rusty's on New Year's eve 2015... The service was Poor (with a capital P). The $35 and up entrees were 99% the same items that were on the buffet. Food was cold and bland in the buffet (I know this because my children had the buffet), and Food was cold and bland as entrees... unfixable!We had a crabby and ill-mannered old server who hates children and it so clearly showed on his face we felt sick to be there (and no, my children were not loud or running around, they sat through the whole torture session with something close to a smile on their face).Will not be returning to Rusty's Bistro.Oh, I almost forgot: The music was nice and this review does not reflect on the excellent pianist that played all night long. He was amazing! | Menu provides great options if you want to go pricey and nice, or if you want to keep it more budget friendly (as far as possible in a nice hotel restaurant).We ordered from the prix fixe menu. For $30 you get a starter, main, and a dessert. It was plenty of food, and it was all delicious. I had a rack of lamb and my partner had the filet mignon. Each came with mashed potatoes (buttery and creamy), asparagus, and sweet potato puree.Decent wines are a bit expensive. We went with a cheaper bottle and it was just okay, but we would like to see the wine options expand with more affordable and decent bottles.They also offer a buffet on some nights. We did not try it recently, but in the past it has been decent. Based on past experience, the hot dishes tend to suffer from sitting, however.It was a Saturday night and they had a pianist sing and playing a keyboard.

        "The Rusty's Bistro at the Sheraton (in Clearwater) is nothing to brag about. Personally, I hate restaurants where Service and the Food Quality are sub-par but prices are inflated to help elevate the perception... This is definitely one of those restaurants.My family and I had dinner at Rusty's on New Year's eve 2015... The service was Poor (with a capital P). The $35 and up entrees were 99% the same items that were on the buffet. Food was cold and bland in the buffet (I know this because my children had the buffet), and Food was cold and bland as entrees... unfixable!We had a crabby and ill-mannered old server who hates children and it so clearly showed on his face we felt sick to be there (and no, my children were not loud or running around, they sat through the whole torture session with something close to a smile on their face).Will not be returning to Rusty's Bistro.Oh, I almost forgot: The music was nice and this review does not reflect on the excellent pianist that played all night long. He was amazing! | Menu provides great options if you want to go pricey and nice, or if you want to keep it more budget friendly (as far as possible in a nice hotel restaurant).We ordered from the prix fixe menu. For $30 you get a starter, main, and a dessert. It was plenty of food, and it was all delicious. I had a rack of lamb and my partner had the filet mignon. Each came with mashed potatoes (buttery and creamy), asparagus, and sweet potato puree.Decent wines are a bit expensive. We went with a cheaper bottle and it was just okay, but we would like to see the wine options expand with more affordable and decent bottles.They also offer a buffet on some nights. We did not try it recently, but in the past it has been decent. Based on past experience, the hot dishes tend to suffer from sitting, however.It was a Saturday night and they had a pianist sing and playing a keyboard. It added a nice touch.If you are looking for a good meal in a nice atmosphere, then check out Rusty's. It is definitely a few steps above the touristy options available on Sand Key and Clearwater Beach."

However, it's 45 minutes away so we were saving it for an occasion or a convenient time.

So we arrived around 5pm and the place was packed. Ridiculously so! I'm not sure how/why this many people eat so early on a Friday afternoon...Anyway, we asked if we could place an order for carry-out and they said no, we had to dine-in, but there was at least a 15 minute wait.They told us we HAD to sit at the bar and order at least ONE drink in order to get any pizza. W. T. F.We explained to them our situation and they were not at all sympathetic--they just kept repeating that if we ordered any drink, even a soda, only then could we get a menu to order any food. We probably would have ordered a drink anyway but it was utterly ludicrous that we were forced to.

I'm not sure how/why this many people eat so early on a Friday afternoon...Anyway, we asked if we could place an order for carry-out and they said no, we had to dine-in, but there was at least a 15 minute wait.They told us we HAD to sit at the bar and order at least ONE drink in order to get any pizza. W. T. F.We explained to them our situation and they were not at all sympathetic--they just kept repeating that if we ordered any drink, even a soda, only then could we get a menu to order any food. We probably would have ordered a drink anyway but it was utterly ludicrous that we were forced to. Not to mention, they could have told us over the phone that if we arrived, we would have to sit at the bar and purchase a drink--it felt like a bald-faced attempt to try to squeeze some extra money from customers.In the end, we skipped out and went to Cleveland-Heath instead. It makes me really sad that this happened. I know their pizzas are amazing and they will never lack for customers, but they need to work on their customer service :(\"",

If they could not seat us, the least they could do was offer us something to try to salvage the experience and keep their customers. The server then informed us that although he agreed, the manager inside had made it perfectly clear that he was not interested in doing anything for us and had explicitly refused to come out and deal with the situation personally.What an unprecedented embarrassment.

        "First let me start by saying this church is absolutely stunning and I'd get married here again and deal with the awful director just to get married in this church, my husband on the other would not. Julie Vanderbrook, the church's director was absolutely awful to work with. When booking this church know that if you are not a parishioner you will \"need to find your own priest.\" Ok, understandable. They do many weddings and the priest would never catch a break, but being an out of town bride I asked Ms. Vanderbrook if she had a list of priests in the area that may be able to officiate our ceremony. Her response was \"No, I guess you'll have to find someone who lives here to help you out.\" The night of the rehearsal I arrived 10 minutes late, yes I understand that was rude, but she told my mother \"oh well, we are starting without her!\" It was a stressful time with many moving parts and I apologized. She ran through the rehearsal one time and expected everyone to get it. We were out of there in 20 minutes. No one really knew what they were supposed to do. She didn't explain herself well and we all felt very rushed.The day of the wedding she was an absolute nightmare. Our wedding started at 7:00 and guests who arrived at 6:55 were told, by Ms. Vanderbrook, \"You are late!\". My husband wanted to escort his sister down the aisle and at 6:40 she started rushing him telling him to go go go, finally he had to look at her and say, no one is even here yet, I'm not walking her down. So she continued to nag and he ignored her. Now what really sent me over the edge was how I found out she treated my mother. It was 6:45 and because the church doesn't have a bridal room we had to get a room at the hotel across the street and since we were so rushed through the rehearsal and I was a nervous bride I didn't realize I was supposed to be there at 6:45 and to be completely honest, I didn't want to be standing around while people filed in and see me in my dress before I walked down the aisle. My bridesmaids and I arrived at 6:58. At 6:45 this woman had my mother in TEARS. She was incessantly asking my mother, \"Where is your daughter?! Where is your daughter?! She is so rude!\" There were many of instances that she was rude to guests and family members but I'd be writing for days.A wedding is already stressful enough and all Ms. Vanderbrook did was add to the stress and really, escalate it. I do understand that it is New Orleans and you deal with people who may not be considerate but no one in our party was rude, drunk, loud, etc. There was absolutely no reason for this woman to act the way she did. I honestly don't understand why she is the director of weddings at Immaculate Conception. We fully intend to write a letter to the priest and bishop to let them know how she is running the weddings at this church. For the amount of money you pay to get married there, you should not be treated like garbage. | This is a beautiful old church right off of Canal Street. It has these wonderful pews made of wood and iron and impressive stained glass windows. There are several Mass times and refreshments after most Sunday services if you would like to grab coffee, touch bases with a priest, or chat up members and visitors. Besides its beauty, it has many needed ministries for the community. The Harry Tompson Center helps the poor and homeless (http://www.harrytompsoncenter.org/) with the basic needs we take for granted. They even help with mental and legal services. The church is involved with the St. Vincent de Paul Society which offers rental and utility assistance. It has its own tuition-free school for at-risk kids (http://thegoodshepherdschool.org/) and helps support Cafe Reconcile (http://reconcileneworleans.org/) founded by Father Tompson and others. It \"is a nonprofit organization providing at-risk youth (16-22) with opportunities to learn life, interpersonal, and work skills for success.\" It is a culinary training program and is open for lunch service to the public. You can even volunteer online for many of these places (http://76.12.167.60/volunteerform.htm) before your visit!The church also conducts tours the last Saturday of each month (except December) at 3pm if you are interested in hearing about its interesting history (http://jesuitchurch.net/) such as when the church had to be completely disassembled and rebuilt, brick by brick, because of another building's construction."

My husband wanted to escort his sister down the aisle and at 6:40 she started rushing him telling him to go go go, finally he had to look at her and say, no one is even here yet, I'm not walking her down. So she continued to nag and he ignored her. Now what really sent me over the edge was how I found out she treated my mother. It was 6:45 and because the church doesn't have a bridal room we had to get a room at the hotel across the street and since we were so rushed through the rehearsal and I was a nervous bride I didn't realize I was supposed to be there at 6:45 and to be completely honest, I didn't want to be standing around while people filed in and see me in my dress before I walked down the aisle. My bridesmaids and I arrived at 6:58. At 6:45 this woman had my mother in TEARS. She was incessantly asking my mother, \"Where is your daughter?! Where is your daughter?! She is so rude!\" There were many of instances that she was rude to guests and family members but I'd be writing for days.A wedding is already stressful enough and all Ms. Vanderbrook did was add to the stress and really, escalate it. I do understand that it is New Orleans and you deal with people who may not be considerate but no one in our party was rude, drunk, loud, etc. There was absolutely no reason for this woman to act the way she did. I honestly don't understand why she is the director of weddings at Immaculate Conception. We fully intend to write a letter to the priest and bishop to let them know how she is running the weddings at this church. For the amount of money you pay to get married there, you should not be treated like garbage.\"",

Julie Vanderbrook, the church's director was absolutely awful to work with. When booking this church know that if you are not a parishioner you will \"need to find your own priest.\" Ok, understandable. They do many weddings and the priest would never catch a break, but being an out of town bride I asked Ms. Vanderbrook if she had a list of priests in the area that may be able to officiate our ceremony. Her response was \"No, I guess you'll have to find someone who lives here to help you out.\" The night of the rehearsal I arrived 10 minutes late, yes I understand that was rude, but she told my mother \"oh well, we are starting without her!\" It was a stressful time with many moving parts and I apologized. She ran through the rehearsal one time and expected everyone to get it. We were out of there in 20 minutes. No one really knew what they were supposed to do. She didn't explain herself well and we all felt very rushed.The day of the wedding she was an absolute nightmare.

        "Nice store. It has a lot crammed in to it but since it is an outlet that is ok. :) They have pretty much the same stuff as the regular stores plus outlet only items. Like the other Legends outlets the prices are not incredibly low but they have a lot of sales. The staff is helpful and friendly. They honor ON coupons for the regular ON stores. Yay!Other info: If you need maternity or plus sizes head to the S. Reno store. This one does not carry those lines. | I'm only giving this place three stars for two different reasons.- the costumer service is usually very incredible there's specific employees who are always outstanding, not absolutely positive if I'm spelling this correct, but I really like \"kim(one of the managers) mike (one of the other managers) Juan , Erica, and Tori. There always there when I go and always helping me with every little question I have . -there sales are really nice. If you spend enough energy and time you can find anything from 97cents to five dollars . The negatives -the outlet is a mess . But honestly that's all the consumers fault . Just because it's and outlet they think it's okay to trash the place . There's always just three (if it's a good day) employees on the sales floor , there usually 1 or 2 on the registers and maybe they just need more employees.-the wait on a Saturday afternoon . I've been in line for 10m-30m . It's not the best thing to do on a Saturday . But yet again I wouldn't want my cashier rushing me so that the line could move faster .At the end of the day this place isn't so bad . I really like the sales and the employees at this location it's unique in its own ways ."

        "Nice store. It has a lot crammed in to it but since it is an outlet that is ok. :) They have pretty much the same stuff as the regular stores plus outlet only items. Like the other Legends outlets the prices are not incredibly low but they have a lot of sales. The staff is helpful and friendly. They honor ON coupons for the regular ON stores. Yay!Other info: If you need maternity or plus sizes head to the S. Reno store. This one does not carry those lines. | I'm only giving this place three stars for two different reasons.- the costumer service is usually very incredible there's specific employees who are always outstanding, not absolutely positive if I'm spelling this correct, but I really like \"kim(one of the managers) mike (one of the other managers) Juan , Erica, and Tori. There always there when I go and always helping me with every little question I have . -there sales are really nice. If you spend enough energy and time you can find anything from 97cents to five dollars . The negatives -the outlet is a mess . But honestly that's all the consumers fault . Just because it's and outlet they think it's okay to trash the place . There's always just three (if it's a good day) employees on the sales floor , there usually 1 or 2 on the registers and maybe they just need more employees.-the wait on a Saturday afternoon . I've been in line for 10m-30m . It's not the best thing to do on a Saturday . But yet again I wouldn't want my cashier rushing me so that the line could move faster .At the end of the day this place isn't so bad . I really like the sales and the employees at this location it's unique in its own ways ."

        "Even though I work right around the corner, I finally had the chance to check out the Good Oak Bar w/some friends. I feel like we lucked out because we got there around 830ish on a Friday night and were able to snag one of the big wooden booths. I had the old fashioned and it was pretty good. Like others have written about, the attention to the local Arizona detail is what really sets this place apart. If most nights also have around the amount of people tonight did, I think it also really hits the spot since it wasn't crowded and was just a lovely hang. Recommend! | I live Good Oak because it represents a reprieve that characterizes living in the Sonoran Desert. Here's why Good Oak is my favorite Tucson bar:1. Craft: I'm drawn to establishments that develop a craft identity, where the bartenders, for example, can tell me why and how certain flavors develop during fermentation. And where the local vineyards whose products are for sale actually come in for tastings. I'm drawn to Good Oak because the bartenders seem to know and care about what *I* like and they've never recommended something I didn't enjoy. Sometimes I don't feel like just a customer here, not because the staff are friendly, but because when I go into Good Oak I almost feel like I've escaped consumer culture--and that's a kind of reprieve you won't often find (the caveat, however, is that this isn't the cheapest joint in town).Maybe it's the novelty of their beer presses, or the almost hidden location, but this doesn't come together feeling like a bar in a busy downtown area. Maybe it's that it seems like Good Oak cares as much about the alcohol as it does about the customer. It's this atmosphere that makes it idiosyncratically cozy (really, Im just a sucker for the metal and the wood accents). 2. Discreet: Even though it's located downtown, it isn't swarming with Coors Light-soaked undergrads. In fact, it's almost hidden in plain sight. I like to come here with my colleagues for relief drinking after long days at work. It can get loud, but it's mostly pretty reasonable. 3. Arizona local: GO serves beer and wine sourced from Arizona. I love the wine selections, and though they're not necessarily cheap ($8-12/glass), they're *all* excellent, locally-sourced. On a recent visit, I started with the xo coffee stout and finished with a Dragoon IPA, which left me delightfully woozy. And while you can now find Dragoon brews in a number of establishments around Tucson, and the selection of swill isn't quite as wide as say, 1702, it's leas about the breadth of selection than the reason for it. If you'd like drink somewhere that's discreet and comfortably idiosyncratic, I'd highly recommend Good Oak"
