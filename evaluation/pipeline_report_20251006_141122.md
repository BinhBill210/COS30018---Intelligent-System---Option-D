## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. Fix: ChromaDB not accessible: Could not connect to a Chroma server. Are you sure it is running?
1. Fix: ReviewSearchTool failed: Could not connect to a Chroma server. Are you sure it is running?
1. Fix: No tools extracted from agent response

### System Improvements
1. **Tool Name Mapping**: Update tool name normalization to handle more variations
2. **Database Setup**: Ensure all database tables are properly initialized
3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and recovery in tool calls
4. **Response Parsing**: Enhance tool call extraction patterns
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize slow tools and reduce API call latency

### Next Steps
1. Run full evaluation with all 100 test cases
2. Implement recommended fixes
3. Add more sophisticated evaluation metrics
4. Create automated daily evaluation pipeline
5. Add performance benchmarking and regression testing
