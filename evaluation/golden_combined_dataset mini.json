Two months later, I am still dealing with a first bill of over $400. It has been impossible to get an answer regarding the credits they promised. The turnover seems to be a problem too since the person who helped set up our account is no longer there. Managers do not return calls. Overall, a terrible experience with this store. I gotta say that Verizon customer service has been excellent to deal with, but still unable to resolve my issue. Not surprised to see so many one-star ratings for this store. | As far as Verizon Wireless stores go, this is better than most. That I've given it two stars isn't saying much about other Verizon stores. I've always had better luck at Circuity City. Inside, the store is very nicely laid out, brightly lit, and well organized. As well, it's well staffed.I've been to this store twice, and both were horrible experiences. The first was to buy Blackberry devices for myself and my wife, about a year and a half ago. A simple transfer took almost three hours for no apparent reason. They've got one person working the transfer desk, with a line of people waiting for their new phones, and ten employees walking around the sales floor, effectively doing nothing, since the only customers in there had already purchased phones and were waiting for them. A good manager would have cross-trained their employees and moved sales people to the support desk to help transfer people to their new phones. Even with the long wait, the manager never did so, just stood around and talked with his sales people.The second time I was at the store, I'd gone because my Blackberry stopped working. The tech looked inside the phone and said that the indicator had gone off, indicating that the phone had gotten wet. I told him I had to go through my insurance, rather than giving me a new phone, and I asked to speak to the manager. While speaking to the manager, she was unwilling to budge on the insurance claim, and wouldn't even give me the benefit of the doubt, given my 12+ year history with Verizon, and the fact that in the seven years I'd had equipment coverage, this was my first claim.These two experiences have made me never want to walk into another Verizon store again. Do yourself a favor and head to the Best Buy Mobile store in Moorestown Mall."], "citations_gt": ["CL78cgwnDPys9KzgJUfIBQ::reviews::keyword::store"] }
