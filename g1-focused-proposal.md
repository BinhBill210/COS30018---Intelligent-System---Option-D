## Introduction

We are pleased to submit our formal project proposal for COS30018 â€“ Intelligent Systems, Project Assignment Option D, focusing on Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. Our team of five second and third-year university students has elected to pursue a **primary focus on Goal 1 (G1): Develop and deploy an LLM-powered autonomous agent**.

**Primary Objective (G1)**: We have selected the **Business Improvement Agent** mission as our core deliverable. Our proposed agent will analyze customer review datasets to provide comprehensive sentiment analysis, identify key thematic patterns, and generate actionable recommendations for business improvement.

**Secondary Objective (G2)**: If time and resources permit after successfully completing G1, we will explore extending our single agent into a multiagent system with specialized sub-agents for different aspects of business analysis.

Our strategic approach prioritizes delivering a robust, fully-functional autonomous agent that demonstrates sophisticated LLM-powered capabilities rather than attempting to build multiple less-developed agents.

## Project Strategy & Scope
