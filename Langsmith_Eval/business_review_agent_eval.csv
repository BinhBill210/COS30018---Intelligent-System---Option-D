Give me all the review about Body Cycle Spinning Studio,"
        Review 1: "". Carly was happy to help my new-to-cycling sister and I in adjusting our bikes, and explaining all of the terminology she would be using during her class. She was particularly mindful of my injuries (lumbar back spasm and degeneration of left knee cartilage) as she adjusted me into my bike, and reminded me to not forget that this was ""my ride"" and to listen to my body, above all. The next 30 minutes was a blur of sweat, music, encouragement, challenge, and accomplishment"" - Stars: 5.0 - Date: 2013-03-07
        Review 2: ""Great class with Russell who really made an effort to make sure every cyclist new and regular was properly set up on their bikes. Also showed and reminded everyone of proper form. Bring your own shoes or cycle in your sneakers."" - Stars: 5.0 - Date: 2015-07-12
        Review 3: "". What's more, when I returned two days later, he saw my name on the list and came in to personally apologize for the mix up. He truly went above and beyond to make me feel like a valued customer. When I went to class this morning, Russell was taking customers' coats as they arrived and hanging them up. I've never seen such a thing at a fitness studio! At the end of class, Russell was waiting with a mop to clean up all of the sweat we generated during an intense ride"" - Stars: 5.0 - Date: 2012-12-28
        Review 4: ""This place is awesome! A friend dragged me here after spotting an event on facebook called B cubed (B^3) = Bikes.Bootcamp.Brunch. For $25 you got a 30 minute spin session (courtesy of Russell who is also the owner and is fantastic!), a run to the art museum (which I skipped and drove to the art museum cause I parked on the street, oh, and I also hate running!)"" - Stars: 5.0 - Date: 2016-06-26
        Review 5: "". Everyone there is super helpful and all give amazing customer service. I'm a fan, can you tell."" - Stars: 5.0 - Date: 2015-07-14
